0x840,"A few things. You might have negative- frequency dependent selection going on where the least common phenotype, reflected by genotype, is going to have an advantage in the environment. For instance, if a prey animal such as a vole were to have a light and a dark phenotype, a predator might recognize the more common phenotype as food.  So if the light voles are more common, foxes may be keeping a closer eye out for light phenotypic voles, recognising them as good prey. This would reduce the light causing alleles due to increased predation and the dark genotypes would increase their proportion of the population until this scenario is reversed. This cycle continues perpetually. \n\nHowever, this is unlikely to be strictly yearly as it usually takes more time than a year for an entire populations allele frequencies to change enough to make a large enough difference to alter fitness. \n\nMore likely on a *year to year* basis, the population is experiencing fluctuating selection where alternating conditions in the environment favor one genotype over another. Perhaps a plant species is living in an area that is flooded every other year and the two phenotypes in the population are plants that do much better in the dryer year and one that does better in the wet year. If there is no flooding, the dry-type genotype will have more fitness leading to more offspring and therefore more dry alleles in the population, however, in flooded years the wet-liking phenotype will do better and propagate the wet genes.",Biology,might frequency dependent selection going least common reflected going advantage prey animal vole light dark predator might recognize common phenotype light vole fox may keeping closer eye light phenotypic recognising good would reduce light causing allele due increased predation dark genotype would increase proportion population scenario cycle continues unlikely strictly yearly usually take time year entire population allele frequency change enough make large enough difference alter likely population experiencing fluctuating selection alternating condition environment favor one genotype perhaps plant specie living area flooded every year two phenotype population plant much better dryer year one doe better wet genotype fitness leading offspring therefore dry allele flooded year phenotype better propagate wet,0,0,4

There is good agreement in the so-called solar parameters between solar oscillations measured by SNO, Borexino, SuperK, and others with long-baseline reactor measurements by KamLand. The former measurement will improve considerably with DUNE and the latter with JUNO. The so-called atmospheric parameters show even more impressive agreement with atmospheric measurements by SuperK and IceCube, long-baseline accelerator measurements by MINOS, NOvA, and T2K, and medium baseline reactor measurements by Daya Bay and RENO. This paints a clear picture that neutrinos oscillate which guarantees that at least two of them have mass.\n\nWhat does that mass look like from a model building point of view? The fact that there are lots of options is exactly why neutrinos represent the biggest open questions in particle physics. They almost certainly have a Dirac mass term from a Yukawa coupling to the Higgs field, same as the rest of the fermions. This guarantees at least two new gauge singles (i.e. right handed sterile neutrinos). The story is obviously more complicated than that since we don't know if lepton number is a good symmetry. If it is not, then there is also a Majorana mass term with, presumably, additional fermionic gauge singlets.\n\nOf course model builders have developed many more interesting models to give neutrinos mass, some of which don't include right handed neutrinos, but they do all include several additional particles anyway.",Physics,think converged last neutrino well established many many good agreement solar parameter solar oscillation measured others reactor measurement former measurement improve considerably dune latter atmospheric parameter show even impressive agreement atmospheric measurement superk accelerator measurement medium baseline reactor measurement daya bay paint clear picture neutrino oscillate guarantee least two doe mass look like model building point fact lot option exactly neutrino represent biggest open question particle almost certainly dirac mass term yukawa coupling higgs rest guarantee least two new gauge single right handed sterile story obviously complicated since know lepton number good also majorana mass term additional fermionic gauge course model builder developed many interesting model give neutrino include right handed include several additional particle,0,0,1

[I said this, and you rejected this claim in the following]\n\nIf you mean:  the amount of energy required to re-uptake the CO2 from the atmosphere has no relation to the energy that was spent in releasing and mixing the CO2 into the atmosphere, then you're very simply wrong about this.  \n\n... \n\nregardless of the ""implementation"" of the process, man-made or natural, it is absolutely the case that when you mix the CO2 into the atmosphere, \_energy is spent\_.  And if that CO2 is taken back, energy is spent again, and the amount on this ""uptake"" is \_necessarily at least as much as on the first mixing\_ --- *in practice*, it's a lot more.   This is very straightforward thermodynamics -- it's why and how a perpetual motion machine is impossible.  \n\n\nPerhaps I've mislead you by letting out, early on, an air that this relation between the energies is somehow 1-to-1, when it's not -- for example, when you burn a log, depending on your furnace etc, ""only"" about 15-30% of the energy released by the burn goes into heating the exhaust flue (and is thereby a component of the ""issue with entropy"" that the fart was originally about).  If I let the impression that 100% does, then it's my mistake.  HOWEVER, the energetics and thermodynamics of releasing that exhaust into the atmosphere is *still* such that I say confidently: you would have to use \_at least\_ the energy equivalent to that of burning the original log to get the exhaust back. “\n\n[End of your quote. If you don’t feel like reading all of this, I would encourage you to just think about what I say at the very end of this comment regarding the way you seem to think you understand the thermodynamics of the situation better than published experts in this field whose views I have explicitly cited in my argument] \n\nIn the above, you pretty clearly said that you thought that the amount of the energy gained was relevant in determining the thermodynamic feasibility. It is not. You now seem to be claiming that instead you were just hoping to estimate the amount of energy that would be required to capture the carbon, but it is also not useful as an estimate of how much energy would be required (even if it just so happens to be close if you assume all of the emissions were via natural gas, but there’s no reason to assume all emissions are from natural gas). The blog post that you sent does not care at all about the source. All that I’ve been trying to argue is that the energy gained from the CO2 source does not matter. It seems like maybe you now agree with this claim, or perhaps you agreed with it all along. \n\nTo assess the thermodynamic feasibility of carbon capture, you have to have to carry out a pretty involved modeling of the capture process. Any such model will make assumptions which other experts may or may not agree with, which is why there are a range of estimates for the energy cost. It is made especially difficult to estimate because we don’t actually know what the efficiency of future technology will be, so any estimate that relies on taking some thermodynamic limiting case and then estimating the energy expenditure of a real life material by guessing some efficiency as a percentage of the thermodynamic limiting case will be highly dependent on what someone guesses for the efficiency. As I mentioned above, the direct air capture article that I referred you to mentions how a typical efficiency range can be from 5-40%. Depending on how efficient researchers are able to make a material, it could end up being energetically worthwhile. There is no thermodynamically determined limit that guarantees carbon capture will use too much energy to make it worthwhile. Again, I wonder why you are so insistent that I am wrong about this? At this point I’ve summarized several journal articles about carbon capture, and they agree with what I’m saying. That carbon capture review article is what gave me the impression you were incorrect in the first place (I read it a long time ago). It’s one thing for you to say that me, a random redditor whose background you know nothing about is wrong, but why is it that you’re so sure you understand carbon capture better than experts in the field that I’ve cited?\n\nEdit: \nAlso, when you said this it confused me:\n“>your initial claim that thermodynamics limits DAC to a point where it couldn’t be feasible no matter how efficient it got.\n\nShow me where I've said that DAC is impossible, instead of unfeasible, or -- pretty please -- shut up.  Intentional misrepresentation is *not* civil.”\n\nIn the post where you quoted me I said “[you] claim that ... DAC ... couldn’t be feasible no matter how efficient it got” and then you tell me to “shut up” for saying that you said that “DAC is imposible instead of unfeasible.” I’m very confused by what caused your aggressive response. As far as I can tell, I’m this part where you quoted me I’m saying that you claimed DAC was unfeasible? If you think that when I said “couldn’t be feasible” this was meant to be synonymous with “impossible” rather than “unfeasible,” then either you’ve misread what I wrote or I wrote it poorly. In either case, I was not trying to intentionally misrepresent what you said. I apologize if it came off like that, and I’m also sort of surprised by your hostile tone here.\n\nTo clarify what I meant by ""Hopefully we can both agree on this point, which is different from your initial claim that thermodynamics limits DAC to a point where it couldn’t be feasible no matter how efficient it got,"" what I was trying to say is that my impression of what you have been saying is something like ""thermodynamics limits the energy efficiency of carbon capture in a way that no matter how efficient carbon capture technology got, it would not be energetically feasible because the minimum energy required to capture carbon would be too high to make it worthwhile."" It's clear that it is possible for people to capture CO2 from the air since there are already plants that do this, what I meant regarding the possibility or feasibility of it had to do with whether or not the energy cost would render direct air capture a practical way to reduce the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. I think that practical is likely a better word than ""possible"" or ""feasible"" or whatever else, and I probably expressed what I was saying in an unclear way, but I hope from context it was clear what I meant.\n\nPerhaps what I wrote expressed the sentiment that I was trying to convey poorly; you were rather ungenerous to me in assuming that I was trying to put words in your mouth as a rhetorical trick to ""win"" the argument. In any discussion like this, it is obviously important for both people to understand what the other person is saying, and sometimes people misunderstand each other. If you think that I misrepresented what you were saying, I apologize again and I assure you that I wasn't doing so intentionally. Additionally, it is a little bit ironic that I now feel that you've misrepresented me when you said that I intentionally misrepresented you.",Physics,lengthy quote rejected claim made fundamental point come capturing way wa generated affect energy required capture said rejected claim amount energy required atmosphere ha relation energy wa spent releasing mixing simply wrong absolutely case mix taken energy spent amount least much first lot straightforward thermodynamics perpetual motion machine mislead letting early air relation energy somehow burn depending furnace energy released burn go heating exhaust flue thereby component fart wa originally let impression energetics thermodynamics releasing exhaust atmosphere say would use energy equivalent burning original log get exhaust feel like reading would encourage think say end comment regarding way seem think understand thermodynamics situation better published expert field whose view explicitly cited pretty clearly said thought amount energy gained wa relevant determining thermodynamic seem claiming instead hoping estimate amount energy would required capture also useful estimate much energy would required happens close assume emission via natural reason assume emission natural blog post sent doe care trying argue energy gained source doe seems like maybe agree perhaps agreed ass thermodynamic feasibility carbon carry pretty involved modeling capture model make assumption expert may may agree range estimate energy made especially difficult estimate actually know efficiency future technology estimate relies taking thermodynamic limiting case estimating energy expenditure real life material guessing efficiency percentage thermodynamic limiting case highly dependent someone guess mentioned direct air capture article referred mention typical efficiency range depending efficient researcher able make could end energetically thermodynamically determined limit guarantee carbon capture use much energy make wonder insistent wrong point summarized several journal article carbon agree carbon capture review article gave impression incorrect first place read long time one thing say random redditor whose background know nothing sure understand carbon capture better expert field said confused initial claim thermodynamics limit dac point feasible matter efficient said dac instead pretty please shut intentional misrepresentation post quoted said claim dac feasible matter efficient tell saying said imposible instead confused caused aggressive far part quoted saying claimed dac wa think said wa meant synonymous rather either misread wrote wrote either wa trying intentionally misrepresent apologize came like also sort surprised hostile tone clarify meant agree different initial claim thermodynamics limit dac point feasible matter efficient wa trying say impression saying something like limit energy efficiency carbon capture way matter efficient carbon capture technology would energetically feasible minimum energy required capture carbon would high make clear possible people capture air since already plant meant regarding possibility feasibility whether energy cost would render direct air capture practical way reduce amount think practical likely better word whatever probably expressed wa saying unclear hope context wa clear wrote expressed sentiment wa trying convey rather ungenerous assuming wa trying put word mouth rhetorical trick discussion like obviously important people understand person sometimes people misunderstand think misrepresented apologize assure little bit ironic feel misrepresented said intentionally misrepresented,0,0,4

0xc12,"Start simple. \n\nModelling things like this usually involves calculating the result numerically because the analytic results can get out of hand quickly. \n\nThe simplest numerical method is finite difference on a regular grid - you're essentially sampling the field at the grid points. Since this is a vector field, you'd need a 3d value at each point. You can convert the field equations to finite difference representations, and then look at how the results depend on the grid spacing.\n\nFEMM is based on the observation that a lot of the space will be oversampled (lots of points in a relatively uninteresting bit of field) in order to give enough points to the interesting bits. So instead we can collect regions of space together and call each one an element, and then put more smaller elements in the interesting bits of space, and fewer in the empty bits. This way the calculation effort is concentrated where it is needed. \n\nThe cost, though, is that FEMM is far more complex to understand, and involves choices about how you will set up your elements and whether you will dynamically add or change those elements as the calculation progresses (e.g. adapting to the shape of the field, or for time-dependent calculations).

0x1d64,"\> would that change what we think we know about evolution?'\n\nNot really. If a species finds a stable niche that doesn't entirely disappear during episodes of mass extinction, it can remain morphologically similar for hundreds of millions of years.\n\nMost selection, at most times, drives species to remain near their local optimum in the fitness landscape. This equilibrium is punctuated by bursts of rapid evolution when the environment changes dramatically and the selection pressures a species is subject to change, or in small isolated populations where genetic drift can mean a random walk across the fitness landscape.\n\nAnd even in species that seem morphologically similar to those that existed hundreds of million years ago, there can be substantial evolution. Most organisms are in a ""Red Queen's"" race with faster evolving parasites and pathogens, so even though their gross appearance may match an unchanging local optimum of the fitness landscape, they probably had major changes to immune response, which wouldn't be visible in the fossile record.\n\nMy understanding is that the nautiluses we find today are scarcely distinguishable from some nautiloids that existed prior to the end Permian mass extinction, and morphologically similar to nautiloids from 500 Mya. Some lampreys haven't changed much in 360 million years.

Natural occurring nuclides are all the nuclides that are found in nature, while primordial are the ones that still exists to today that where here when the earth was formed. The reason why uranium 238 is the heaviest natural occurring nucliede, is because all the other nuclides that have been discovered have half lives less than a million years, and since the earth is ~4,5 billion years they have all decayed. \nToday we know of about 3300 nuclides, most of them are unstable and only exist for less than a couple of minutes.\nIn the 1950s it was believed that some nuclides heavier than Z=92 should have half lives in the magnitude of billions of years. The reason why it was believed, is because the theory of ""the island of stability"" predicted that there should be ""magic numbers"" (the ratio between neutrons to protons) that makes the nucleus ""extremely"" stable. As it turned out when our understanding and theory got better, these super heavy nuclides in the island of stability do have longer half lives than nearby nuclides, but instead of billions of years, they have maybe a couple of years to a couple of 100-1000 years. Which is still a lot more stable than their respective neighbors with half lives of some seconds. \nThe hunt is not over though!

Because I've tried b12 vape juuls and I felt an effect.\n\n>OP: As others have kindly, and correctly, suggested, you might want to abandon this line of inquiry. (I trained as a pharmacist and I actually understand this stuff.) When medications (including vitamins) are developed for different modes of drug delivery (oral [capsule/tablet/liquid], inhalation, parenteral, etc.) they are combined with other ingredients (excipients) that are intended for that mode of delivery only. Frequently, the active ingredient represents only a small portion of the delivery form. If someone tries to retroactively deliver a drug by a different mode (e.g., inhalation or injection), he/she is placing substances that were not intended for that organ into one's body. In the lungs, that can cause granulomas to develop and in the blood, clots that could reach vital organs. Also, the salt of the active agent might not be as soluble as needed, regardless of any misguided use of a nebulizer to make it so. Please do not consider putting anything in your body (or anybody else's) in a manner that it was not intended, there are enough problems in the world already, and you don't need to add to them.\n\n1. If the B vitamin liquid supplement is a sublingual how does your body break off the EXcipients/fillers that are attached to the molecule vitamins in just the mouth? Simply with saliva? So can you use it to break down and separate the fillers from the B vitamins?\n\n2. All vitamins are small molecules by default but because the supplement contains fillers which attached themselves to the vitamins because of the procedure cause it to become and big sized one collective. If they are collective it has to first be broken down into individual atoms, so the b vitamins have to be separated from the fillers otherwise if it gets directly into the body you won't be able to use it.\n\n3. So a Nebulizer breaks them down the atoms (vitamins and fillers in supplement) into small enough particle size your lungs can absorb, but the fillers are still attached to the vitamins, so can your lungs then separate them as it does with oxygen in air? Even pure B vitamin like just b12 and alcohol because alcohol is not produced by the body so once in the blood directly from injection together with b12 it will not do separate them as your body doesn't recognize alcohol which has changed the structure of the b12 which also changed the b12 into a big particle size. Therefore it has to go trough the gut system. But my idea here is WHAT IF the lungs (similarly to the gut) can also separate them into individual pieces as in detach the vitamins and recognize the essentialness of it therefore absorb it into the blood while exhaling the fillers? I guess your body absorbs everything including the fillers because it does when people smoke nicotine which isn't found in the body naturally. But the main thing here is that your lungs can separate the vitamins from the fillers once the nebulizer has made them into a small particle size? If the vitamin has other non natural supplement in there with the vitamin that your body doesnt have inside of itself naturally, then your body wont able to use and separate the vitamin from the filler whatever it is. When you add a filler depending on what it will most of the time attach clump together with the vitamin making it unusable and big. therefore, the oxygen is also clumped in with other stuff in the air, so before they go into the blood as you inhaled the air, your lungs separate them individually because things like nitrogen etc are not made by the body naturally. or exepection",Biology,got technically work filler might cause problem tried vape juuls felt others might want abandon line trained pharmacist actually understand medication developed different mode drug delivery combined ingredient intended mode delivery active ingredient represents small portion delivery someone try retroactively deliver drug different mode inhalation placing substance intended organ cause granuloma develop clot could reach vital salt active agent might soluble regardless misguided use nebulizer make please consider putting anything body anybody manner wa enough problem world need add b vitamin liquid supplement sublingual doe body break attached molecule vitamin simply use break separate filler b vitamin small molecule default supplement contains filler attached vitamin procedure cause become big sized one collective ha first broken individual b vitamin separated filler otherwise get directly body able use nebulizer break atom filler small enough particle size lung filler still attached lung separate doe oxygen even pure b vitamin like alcohol alcohol produced body blood directly injection together separate body recognize alcohol ha changed structure also changed big particle therefore ha go trough gut idea lung also separate individual piece detach vitamin recognize essentialness therefore absorb blood exhaling guess body absorbs everything including filler doe people smoke nicotine found body main thing lung separate vitamin filler nebulizer ha made small particle vitamin ha non natural supplement vitamin body doesnt inside body wont able use separate vitamin filler whatever add filler depending time attach clump together vitamin making unusable oxygen also clumped stuff go blood inhaled lung separate individually thing like nitrogen etc made body exepection,0,0,4

Whereas academia has little funding and lots of student time, industry is time-poor and willing to spend money to make the best use of it.

From there, the viral genome will remain in the genome until the ""right time"", upon which it will be activated, begin producing viruses, and lyse the cell. This can be long-term and take however long it needs for the viral genes to be activated.\n\nLysing: The virus will override the replication machinery of the host cell, and redirect that machinery to replicating the viral genome instead of the host genome. Tons of viruses will be produced, so many that the cell will literally burst and release tons of other viruses.\n\nNow, there is another possible fate. It could be the case that the viral genome integrates itself into the genome of a cell, but just never gets the chance to ever begin replicating. It just kind of stays there. Then, it's possible that when the host cell replicates its own genome, a mutation will occur in the viral segment of the genome which will render the viral genome useless. If this happens, the mutated (and therefore dysfunctional) viral DNA will sort of just sit there in the host cell DNA forever and the cell will never lyse.

I found two methods for selectively protecting a phenol in the presence of a primary alcohol - one with trityl (very difficult product to isolate and low yield) and one method doing a very similar transformation protecting with ethyl carbonate, mesylating the primary OH and reacting with DEA to add the amine and deprotect in one step. Very low yield. Also tried tosylating and similar outcome. Did a reaction with PBr3 and got the primary alcohol selectively transformed but low yield and not sure if I'll have difficulty adding the amine there in the presence of a phenol. One of the major byproducts I've gotten when attempting to add amine is the elimination product to get a monosubstituted alkene so I've tried using different bases to deprotonate the DEA but doesn't seem to be helping.

0x23f5,"I often see posts like this,\n\nThere is a lot of anxiety in people about ""chemicals"". Be it lead in tinned food, cyanide in almonds, passive smoke vapour from cigarettes. The lists of ""health hazards"" is practically limitless. But ""hazard"" is a sliding scale. You can technically die of a cyanide overdose from eating almonds (you'd have to eat astronomical amounts). There are cases of people overdosing on bananas (potassium has radioactive isotopes). What I'm getting at is there are things you should worry about, and things you shouldn't. And this is firmly in the ""don't need to worry about"" category.\n\nMuch bigger health concerns: smoking, drinking, obesity, diabetes, lack of exercise. \n\nNow this may be a totally innocent ""rabbit hole"" you've gone down. But this also very common in people who go on to develop more severe stress / anxiety about chemicals in the world around us. If you are feeling yourself becoming anxious when thinking about chemicals, please look into chemophobia and the call to nature fallacy.\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemophobia\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_nature\n\nThis wiki article is a good place to start. \n\nNow onto your specific issue with lead:\n\nYes, lead can bio accumulate. Yes, noone has found any health benefits to having lead in your diet. Have you ever met someone who's got lead poisoning from eating food and living a normal lifestyle? Almost certainly not. That's because governing bodies put regulations on how much lead contamination can be present in food. \n\nThat means someone, somewhere has worked out limits for exposures/doses to limit bio accumulation in humans. (In fact, many people work on this and other regulations). Even if there is not formal ""safe"" level, there is somewhere a ""practically safe"" level, where the concentration is low enough that we don't see health side effects in a normal populace. (Again, exact values may be unknown or disputed. Consider that lead has been around for 4000 ish years, and most cases of lead poisoning are either acute exposure, or from long term profession related exposure (eg, people working with lead paints)\n\nFor example, in the 1980s lead limits for tinned food were 4x higher (0.4 ppm Vs 0.1) than they are today, and even then, actual cases of chronic lead poisoning back then were low. Because they were sealing tin cans with lead solder. That no longer happens.\n\nI think my TLDR is: please ignore if this was an innocent ""rabbit hole"" question. If not, and you find yourself becoming anxious, I strongly advise you find online resources for chemistry, so you have a better understanding of things like concentration, doses, etc. There are tonnes of resources out there.\n\nThanks for taking time to read this!",Chemistry,often see post like lot anxiety people lead tinned cyanide passive smoke vapour list practically sliding technically die cyanide overdose eating almond eat astronomical case people overdosing banana ha radioactive getting thing worry thing firmly need worry bigger health lack may totally innocent gone also common people go develop severe stress anxiety chemical world around feeling becoming anxious thinking please look chemophobia call nature wiki article good place onto specific issue lead bio noone ha found health benefit lead ever met someone got lead poisoning eating food living normal almost certainly governing body put regulation much lead contamination present mean somewhere ha worked limit limit bio accumulation many people work even formal somewhere concentration low enough see health side effect normal exact value may unknown consider lead ha around ish case lead poisoning either acute long term profession related exposure people working lead lead limit tinned food higher ppm v even actual case chronic lead poisoning back sealing tin lead longer think tldr please ignore wa innocent find becoming strongly advise find online resource better understanding thing like tonne resource taking time read,0,0,4

Imagine doing a reaction an the kilotonne scale. Lower selectivity means more waste and a 1% drop there is a lot of waste.\n\nTurnover number is another. How many molecules of reactant are converted to product in a second? Catalase is the one that comes to mind as the best here.\n\nStability is the last one that I'd consider. How long can the catalyst perform before it becomes inactive? Sometimes the catalyst can be regenerated like zeolites but you still want to be able to either stay in an active state or be stable enough to regenerate from an inactive state.,Chemistry,couple characteristic good catalyst meaning doe desired transformation time imagine reaction kilotonne lower selectivity mean waste drop lot number many molecule reactant converted product catalase one come mind best last one long catalyst perform becomes sometimes catalyst regenerated like zeolite still want able either stay active state stable enough regenerate inactive,0,0,1

Models like old quantum theory, the Bohr model of the atom, and even the standard model of particle physics today — these models are (or started out as) a cobbling-together of disparate or otherwise questionable techniques (ex. perturbation theory, quantization, renormalization, etc.), some of which still don't have terribly satisfactory explanations today.  Yet, they were or still are ""unreasonably"" successful at ... well, modelling natural physics — or to put it another way, at making accurate predictions.\n\nIt seems to me that people — humans in general, and physicists/scientists by extension — are a bit too biased towards wanting elegance in models, or in the philosophy of science concerning those models.  While there are certainly some historical examples of ""deeper"" discovered theories or underlying mathematical framework being more elegant or simple or (for example as with gauge unification), there are arguably many more historical examples of deeper underlying theories/frameworks simply being more complicated and/or less elegant (ex. quantum mechanics compared to classical mechanics in general).\n\nTo borrow someone else's words (not sure who anymore), I think it's important not to confuse the quest for truth with a quest for beauty ... too often we want all of nature's loose ends to all be tied up neatly, but nature is under no obligation to be tame or elegant at all.  It's nice that we find it to be in some situations, but that doesn't mean we should expect nature to not have its own warts, too.

0x1961,"I would argue this phenomenon is the plate body behaving like a glider in the ground-effect region, and so extremely close to the ground, that viscous drag forces enter the system as well. \n\n(No particular order)\nEffect 1: as the plate approaches the floor at constant speed, the volume of air remaining below the plate diminishes linearly with the distance, so the exit-air’s volume flow rate should be constant over plate distance by this geometry. \n\nEffect 2: as the distance diminishes, the size of the escape windows for the air diminishes linearly. \n\nCombining 1 and 2, you have a constant volume flow rate getting restricted to a smaller and smaller conduit. The fluid speed tries to increase to maintain constant flow rate and constant plate speed, but this acceleration takes work. And the work done to accelerate the air is  coming from the plate’s downward kinetic energy. Therefore the plate slows down (at least in part) from this principle of needing to accelerate a fluid. \n\nEffect 3: when the plate gap gets quite small, there is now an exponentially increasing viscous drag impeding the air’s acceleration along the escape path. The air’s inability to get out fast enough causes a pressure rise, and the plate’s downward motion is decelerated even stronger now. Now it’s on a more pronounced “air cushion” but time is limited before it runs out. \n\nEffect 4: For very light and very large plate, there exists a critical gap size where the rising air pressure is almost able to counter the weight of the plate. It appears floating, initial downward speed is gone, but a small downward speed is still required for the air’s pressure to remain high. Now that the plate’s weight is almost balanced, the motion from here forward is now roughly constant. The plate approaches the floor at a constant speed in this regime, where the work of gravity on the plate equals the work required to force the viscous air through this tiny gap. \n\nEffect 5: now the plate may have had some forward momentum! Or otherwise, with the plate in the floating regime, air might realistically leave faster on one side, giving the plate a tilt. Now it “slides downhill” on this inclined air cushion. \n\nEffect 6: there now also exists some forward speed of the plate where the fresh air entering the leading edge of the gap is almost able to feed and sustain the air cushion indefinitely. The plate’s slow, constant descent onto the floor is now delayed even further by this \n\nIn all, the total combination of these effects can make falling, light, large plates stop descending, start sliding forward, and take a very unexpectedly long time to actually hit the floor and stop moving.",Physics,would argue phenomenon plate body behaving like glider extremely close viscous drag force enter system particular plate approach floor constant volume air remaining plate diminishes linearly volume flow rate constant plate distance distance size escape window air diminishes constant volume flow rate getting restricted smaller smaller fluid speed try increase maintain constant flow rate constant plate acceleration take work done accelerate air coming downward kinetic therefore plate slows least principle needing accelerate plate gap get quite exponentially increasing viscous drag impeding acceleration along escape inability get fast enough cause pressure downward motion decelerated even stronger pronounced time limited run light large exists critical gap size rising air pressure almost able counter weight appears initial downward speed small downward speed still required pressure remain weight almost motion forward roughly plate approach floor constant speed work gravity plate equal work required force viscous air tiny plate may forward plate floating air might realistically leave faster one giving plate inclined air also exists forward speed plate fresh air entering leading edge gap almost able feed sustain air cushion constant descent onto floor delayed even total combination effect make large plate stop start sliding take unexpectedly long time actually hit floor stop,0,0,2

Someone in HR leafs through them, discarding most for real or arbitrary reasons, eg, messy, bad grammar, soaked with perfume, totally off topic, weird fonts. This is why it's important to tailor you resume to each job you apply for (not the same as lying, just making the best presentation). \n2. When the stack is whittled down to 20 or so, it's sent to the hiring authority, usually your future boss. S/he will try to whittle the stack down to 5 or 6, and arrange them in some order of priority. \n3. The top 2 or 3 will enter the interview process. In my experience, the top candidates are often already employed by the time I saw at their applications, so I work down the stack until I get a manageable number of interviewees. \n4.

In [one classic study](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature06291), old resting stages of *Daphnia* (along with their pathogens) were dug out of the mud and reanimated. This is basically like using a time machine to hop back and forth and systematically cross-expose parasites and hosts from different time periods.

For species that reproduce fast, it can even change the population within a single year. There's a really cool study system of wild fruit flies in orchards in North America. The researchers working in the orchards have shown that allele frequencies change every year from spring to fall, as the weather becomes warmer and warmer, favoring genotypes that are good at living in warm conditions (the same alleles that are more common farther south, in fact).

0xfe6,"It's not a stupid question, just perhaps an uncomfortable one to consider.\n\nThe answer boils down to ""yes, but..."". Just as we have bred various animals for specific tasks, we could hypothetically breed ourselves for increased strength and durability, or for some other goal. If we can turn wild steppe horses into massive Clydesdales and speedy Arabians, or take grey wolves and turn them into mastiffs and chihuahuas, we can certainly do similar things to ourselves.\n\nThe thing is, though, such changes come with trade-offs. A growing body only has so many resources at its disposal, and sinking those resources into one organ or function takes them away from somewhere else. We humans dump a lot of resources into our huge brains, for example, at the cost of a lot of other things compared to other animals; it's just that our brains provide such a massive advantage that it's worth it.\n\nAnother thing to consider: I think it's in the final episode, but at some point Nolan tells Mark that Viltrumite genetics are so pure that Mark's basically fully-Viltrumite; Mark only inherited a few superficial genes from his human mother. That's not how things work; to a biologist, ""genetically pure"" actually means ""*super* inbred"". \n\nA lot of domestic animal breeds have health problems, especially pure-breds. Not only are pure-breds usually very inbred, but if they've been bred for specific purposes, they tend to be very good at that but worse at other things. If we started breeding humans specifically for strength and durability, or speed, or intelligence, or *whatever*, you're automatically limiting your potential gene-pool, and humans already have quite low genetic diversity compared to other species. Your super-strong humans are probably going to start developing other problems within a few generations, like heart defects or being more prone to cancer.

0x2367,"There's no sterile neutrino that's been discovered. When physicists talk about how we *know* the universe works, there's three active neutrinos and no steriles. There's always searches for new physics going on, and people look in the most likely places (whether that seems most likely because of theory, or because of data).\n\nThere are unexplained experimental signals from two experiments, LSND and MiniBooNE that could both be simultaneously explained by a sterile neutrino at around 1eV^2. This was far from enough for physicists to consider it a discovery, but it's a very, very good reason to do experiments to clarify.\n\nPhysicists don't consider the sterile neutrino to exist, it's considered a plausible hypothetical.\n\nBut the LSND-MiniBooNE data exist. It shows something not understood that needs to be. Part of the reason that LSND and MiniBooNE together is compelling is that they're almost  completely different in the way they work, they're completely different types of neutrino source, detector and interaction physics. It's weird that two experiments that were so different came out with results consistent with the same hypothetical particle (although they are not the only experiments in the world, and if you start combining everything in the world that could theoretically see that particle it gets less convincing).\n\nMicroBooNE was made to be a *lot* like MiniBooNE. It's using the same neutrino source, it's in almost exactly the same place (geographically, they're right next to each other, for physics purposes they're at almost the same distance from the source). MiniBooNE had a weakness - it was not good at telling the difference between electrons and photons. MicroBooNE was designed to be able to do that. So the analyses that were released look for the MiniBooNE event excess either as plausibly coming from electrons or from photons. The analyses that have been shown aren't explicitly stating ""does a sterile neutrino exist"", they're saying ""do we see the same excess as MiniBooNE"", somewhat agnostic to whatever the underlying reason for the excess is. If it's electrons, that's exciting and evidence that goes towards there being a sterile neutrino. If it's photons, that's less exciting and goes toward the idea a background at MiniBooNE was modelled inaccurately. What MicroBooNE actually saw was neither of those things - that the MiniBooNE signal didn't show up at all (at a pretty mediocre statistical signifiance, enough to say ""probably"" but not enough to rule anything out). But if that's true, there's got to be another reason. 3+1 (adding one sterile to the known three active neutrinos) is what experimental physicists talk about because it's the least you have to mess with the model to make it fit the data from these specific experiments. Theoretical physicists talk about a *lot* more things, because they're looking at *theories* that make sense, not just trying to make their data fit.\n\nSo, this is a negative result. It's not a particularly conclusive one, but it is an important one. It's interesting, it's told us a lot, but I probably wouldn't go so far as to say ""heralds new chapter in physics"". Something is going on with the LSND-MiniBooNE signal. MicroBooNE not seeing makes it weirder - which could be physics that is even more exotic (or, in the worst case could be that MiniBooNE and LSND somehow both screwed up in entirely different ways that were somehow very consistent). But there's a strong experimental program under construction to iron this out (or possibly just make the puzzle more confusing). You should look forward to more updates - and understand that there's not just a new fundamental particle every few years: physicists are looking for how the universe works, but they don't get to decide how the universe works, only where are the best places to look for something new.

Life on Earth can be divided into domains and kingdoms and so on, but those are all based on sharing a single common ancestry. If we find something on another planet that looks a lot like a bacterium, but we can show that it didn't evolve from the same ancestor as our bacteria, we can't formally call it a bacterium.

So ""tree of life"" basically becomes a new taxonomic level above domain. Currently we have no need for such a taxonomic level, because it's a category with a single representative (Earth life).\n\nMy point is that humans dont share a common ancestor, we evolved from ourselves, but we have two forms, our ancestors (Very similar to primates, but not decended to them) and our pre ancestors ( our old form, in our old planet, we would have to scrap many things to presume How we lived and were, my hyphotesis is that we behaved like robotic psychics, we were telepaths, used the Power of our minds to do tasks and processses, constantly changing our environment.

It would also require simulating any emotional feelings, separate from standard inputs like sight, sound, touch, taste, temperature, etc.  All environmental variables would need to be simultaneously processed, respective to their constant changes.  Empathy requires the kind of math quantum computers were built for.

0x1022,"This is a hard problem to answer precisely. It is sometimes called the protein folding problem. However, there are physical tendencies and regularities that can be used for understanding.\n\nFirst and probably easiest regularity is that the core of a protein (the part not exposed to the water solvent) is predominately hydrophobic. One way to think of it is that water don’t want those aliphatic chains messing with the nice hydrogen bonds, so amino acids like leucine, iso-leucine, methionine, phenylalanine are pushed away from contact with water. \n\nConversely many polar amino acids, like glutamate, lysine, end up at the exterior of the protein in contact with the water solvent.\n\nMinor note, there are membrane proteins that cross cell membranes. These membranes are hydrophobic in nature, and in those cases the regularities above are inverted. But I limit myself to discuss proteins that are mostly in contact with water inside and outside cells.\n\nHowever, the backbone of a protein contains polar groups. It can be attractive sometimes to bury a polar amino acid side-chain in the core too, and to bind with the buried polar groups. For reasons I will not get into here, buried hydrogen bonds can be very strong. If you find a protein with a buried hydrogen bond, you can expect that to be an important bond to stability or possibly function of said protein. Sometimes you can even have buried “salt bridges” where a negatively charged side-chain (like glutamate) is interacting with a positively charged side-chain (like lysine), and those will be quite strong.\n\nThere are a few special-case amino acids. Proline for example has an odd structure in that its side-chain binds to the backbone twice, not just to the alpha-carbon. Proline tends to “bend” the backbone differently from other amino acids. Therefore if you have one or several nearby prolines in the sequence, that very likely corresponds to a place where the protein forms a loop in terms of its tertiary structure.\n\nAnother special case is glycine, since it lacks a side-chain entirely. That leads to a more flexible backbone. \n\nAnother special case is histidine. This is an amino acid that has a pKa close to physiological pH. That means that by modest changes to the environment, this amino acid can flip between uncharged to charged. You can think of histidine as a way to functionally encode a pH switch. That means histidines tend to show up in places where some such functionality is needed. Great example is the FcRn binding of antibodies.\n\nAnother special case is cystine. This is the only amino acid that can form a covalent bond between side-chains. So called sulphur bridges can form between pairs of cystine side-chains. Covalent bonds are strong and add a great deal to protein stability. So again, if you see cystine amino acids in the sequence, they are often going to become part of sulphur bridges with other cystine amino acids in the sequence of with other chains in a quaternary structure.\n\nA key point in all this is that the tertiary structure is determined by interactions between pairs (or higher) of amino acids. You can therefore never fully say what one particular amino acid side-chain will end up in the tertiary structure. You can say some things to be more or less likely based on the regularities above. However, to say anything with more certainty requires more careful analysis. \n\nLet me take one special observed regularity. The so called [leucine zipper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leucine_zipper) is a motif wherein leucine appears at every seventh sequence position for some stretch. This can be explained as it leads to very favourable dimerization of two helices such that the leucine side-chains “zip up” very well together (recall they are highly hydrophobic). So if you happen to see a handful of leucine amino acids spaced seven positions apart in the sequence, you might guess that’s going to be part of a tertiary (or quaternary) structure of a leucine zipper.\n\nThere are other such regularities. However, they are rarely perfect and rarely sufficient to figure out tertiary structures from sequence alone. For that you need to consider more relations that are more complex that these types of rules-of-thumb I’ve outlined above. \n\nIt is also noteworthy that for most proteins, their tertiary structure is stable under single mutations (say you replace one amino acid with another). So again one single amino acid side-chain change often (not always) does not change the higher-order structure. Some tertiary structures are extremely stable under most mutations. The [immunoglobulin domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_domain) is a good example of a higher-order protein structure that appears in many quite distinct proteins, and nowadays one can predict if a sequence will form such a structure pretty well because of certain highly conserved features in the sequence.\n\nAnyways, this can go on for long, and structural biology is the place to study this in more detail.

0x17f1,"OP: Please allow me to restate your query: What is the essential role of CO2 in aerobic organisms (including humans)? Good question! Aerobic organisms derive most of their energy from respiration, which on a cellular level involves the use of O2 and glucose to generate ATP (a ""currency"" of life). CO2 is created as a waste product and must be removed from cells. This occurs by the CO2 diffusing into the blood where (as others have noted) it forms carbonic acid. The blood carries this to the lungs where it's released and diffused across the alveolar membrane in the alveoli and is exhaled. Based on this, if CO2: (1) Was not generated during respiration, very little ATP would be created and the organism would die; (2) CO2 was not carried into the blood, same result; (3) If CO2 levels rise in the blood, pH would change and enzymes would not function correct, resulting in death; (4) Similar scenarios would occur if the CO2 was not taken to the lungs and exhaled. There are more details to this, but this is the essence of what would happen, none of it good.",Biology,please allow restate essential role aerobic organism good aerobic organism derive energy cellular level involves use glucose generate atp created waste product must removed occurs diffusing blood others form carbonic blood carry lung released diffused across alveolar membrane alveolus based wa generated little atp would created organism would wa carried level rise ph would change enzyme would function resulting similar scenario would occur wa taken lung detail essence would none,0,0,1

Add in the fact that theres varying binding specificity and your enzyme you pick will matter. Some are super specific and wont bind if theres a change while others will bind to anything resembling DNA.\n\nTo have enough radiation to confidentally effect every bit of DNA in a nanoparticle youll also be messing up the tissue that its in. Proteins will also be messed up in the process for instance.\n\nIf the DNA containing lipid nanoparticles were separate from the tissue/enzyme to begin with and you treated it to a prolonged exposure to radiation before adding the nanoparticles to a culture/reaction  mix then sure tho,Biology,dependent enzyme im gonna say gotta understand lot single nano particle lottttttt single strand dna shine radiation sample wont homogenously effect bit dna many go modification dna going much detrimental dna binding add fact varying binding specificity enzyme pick super specific wont bind change others bind anything resembling enough radiation confidentally effect every bit dna nanoparticle youll also messing tissue protein also messed process dna containing lipid nanoparticles separate begin treated prolonged exposure radiation adding nanoparticles mix sure tho,0,0,1

Then you can plot it on a XY plot, where X is concentration, and Y is response (surface area of a peak at given concentration) - that is your calibration curve.\n\nYou use the curve (or more accurately, the function describing it) to find concentrations of compounds in an analysed sample. \n\nYou're supposed to do this for every compound you're looking for.\n\nBesides of the response, the standard also points out the retention times for each of the compounds you're looking for.",Chemistry,basically standard supposed pure form chemical looking sample multiple compound one known run standard incremental example take resulting use surface area peak create linear quadratic function describing relation peak surface area concentration plot xy x response area peak given calibration use curve function describing find concentration compound analysed supposed every compound looking standard also point retention time compound looking,0,0,2

And since all leptons and quarks have a weak interaction (or a component with a weak interaction) it has very weird consequences with how particles gain mass.\n\nIn principle a particle could have multiple effects that give mass and they'd just add up to the physical mass that we observe. And there is one super simple way to add a mass term to the Lagrangian (the Lagrangian allows you to then calculate how stuff moves and interacts and stuff). You just write m \* psibar \* psi where psi and psibar are the fermion and its antiparticle in question and m is some free parameter that is the particle's mass. But because all those fermions interact with a field that picks out the left handed side, such a term is forbidden. Peter Higgs, and others, realized the solution to this: let every fermion couple to a new field and then let this field be non-zero everywhere. This gives something that is equivalent to the above mass term in every way, but also respects the left handedness of particles. This is known as electroweak symmetry breaking and over the last decade has been confirmed to be how reality works.\n\nWith neutrinos its even weirder, but I'm getting pretty far off point.",Physics,someone else weak interaction weird since lepton quark weak interaction component weak ha weird consequence particle gain principle particle could multiple effect give mass add physical mass one super simple way add mass term lagrangian lagrangian allows calculate stuff move interacts write psibar psi psi psibar fermion antiparticle question free parameter fermion interact field pick left handed term peter realized solution let every fermion couple new field let field give something equivalent mass term every also respect left handedness known electroweak symmetry breaking last decade ha confirmed reality neutrino even getting pretty far,0,0,1

I have very light blue eyes and I'm miserable in the sun, but I can have a kid just fine and pass on that trait. If blue eyed people were so inhibited by their blue eyes, we'd die out before we were able to reproduce, but it's just one of those things that has a negligible impact on reproduction.\n\nSo, why do soybeans have more proteins? A bean at one point in time developed a mutation in their DNA and they generate more amino acids and it didn't inhibit their ability to reproduce, or maybe it actually improved their ability to reproduce or adapt to environments, and that's probably cutting edge soybeanology, might be a good topic for a paper.

0x248c,"Any virus will be under selection for higher transmissibility / infectivity. Not because of any ""want"", natural selection doesn't require desires. Most viruses have relatively high mutation rates, and while the vast majority of these mutations will be harmful to viral replication, some may improve transmission. Thanks to high replication rates in hosts (ofther factors being equal), any variants with higher transmissibility will quickly come to dominate the viral population.\n\nUntil recent decades, it was believed that viruses were under selection for *less* virulence (which FYI, means ""disease severity or lethality""), because a virus that rapidly kills or incapacitates its hosts will encounter fewer hosts to infect. For example the 1918 H1N1 influenza was remarkable for being rapidly lethal in susceptible hosts, with some infected with severe disease going from asymptomatic to dead in under a day. This actually hindered its spread, as the infected had only a very brief window of time to spread the disease. It perhaps should come as no surprise that modern relatives of H1N1 are far less virulent.\n\nHowever, there are some important exceptions. If a virus is normally transmitted in a pre-symptomatic stage of infection, there will be little selection for less virulence. For transmission, it wont matter much if all infected drop dead if there are many days in which hosts are infections and in contact with others.\n\nAnd if a virus relies on the same mechanism for both transmissibility and virulence, then the positive selection for transmissibility can entail some selection for higher virulence. For example, the binding affinity of the SARS CoV-2 spike protein for host ACE receptors has effects both on lowering the effective infectious dose / inoculum (thus increasing  transmissibility), as well as increasing the rate of viral replication within hosts, plausibly leading to viral replication outpacing host immune response. The Delta variant has nearly doubled transmissibility compared to wild type, and somewhat higher virulence in some host age groups. Here, its possible that the expected selection for higher transmissibility is also bringing some selection for higher virulence.",Biology,virus selection higher transmissibility natural selection require virus relatively high mutation vast majority mutation harmful viral may improve thanks high replication rate host factor variant higher transmissibility quickly come dominate viral recent wa believed virus selection virulence mean severity virus rapidly kill incapacitates host encounter fewer host example influenza wa remarkable rapidly lethal susceptible infected severe disease going asymptomatic dead actually hindered infected brief window time spread perhaps come surprise modern relative far le important virus normally transmitted stage little selection le wont matter much infected drop dead many day host infection contact virus relies mechanism transmissibility positive selection transmissibility entail selection higher binding affinity sars spike protein host ace receptor ha effect lowering effective infectious dose inoculum increasing well increasing rate viral replication within plausibly leading viral replication outpacing host immune delta variant ha nearly doubled transmissibility compared wild somewhat higher virulence host age possible expected selection higher transmissibility also bringing selection higher,0,0,1

0x1118,"I think the word you're looking for is altruism, and act of compassion towards another unrelated organism with little to no regard for the risk to oneself or compensation of such an act. In humans it is evident, although there is an ongoing debate on whether an act can be truly altruistic given that, on a subconscious level, it is almost exclusively beneficial to be compassionate towards others, that is in most circumstances being kind to others earns us positive endorphins, a feeling of satisfaction when you help someone you don't know, which is the pinnacle of evolution in social animals. We are hard wired to sacrifice for others due to the parent-offspring bond which is so strong it extends to other potentially unrelated people and even other species. The same can be said for cetaceans, which are not far behind us in terms of social evolution. Although they may not be aware, or even capable of being aware of a potential payoff for helping a distressed swimmer at their own risk (although they likely do have these cognitive capabilites, at least where it concerns helping unrelated members of their own species), their social cognition is also hard wired to aid conspecifics and other creatures (humans, seals, other whales) based on their cognitively advanced awareness of present danger and the panicked behaviour of the organism in distress. Again, the payoff is positive endorphins rather than, let's say, the abstract idea of ""I'll scratch your back if you scratch mine"". I'm not sure this meta study has been done, but I would hypothesise that the greater sociality of a species, the greater frequency of acts deemed to be altruistic will be seen in that species, which simply means the more social an animal is, the more it will behave in a selfless manner towards non-related organisms. But again, there is a reward whether you're aware of it or not, that being positive endorphins. One is certainly aware of the positive effect these endorphins have on the body and mind, and being aware of this benefit thus calls into question the ""selfless"" nature of putting yourself at risk for others.

It's hard to say what pressures we place on the space of ideas we have about the world without being able to examine things from a nonhuman perspective. I think people find solace in attributing order and meaning to the patterns we observe and our place inside them. That might be limiting us from a more integrated view of nature - the word ""uni verse"" already attributes a singular harmony to reality, but it's entirely possible it's all a discordant chaotic mess in the end. I'm not sure where that leaves us considering we do still make an ""unreasonable"" level of progress as you say. \n\nI don't disagree on any particular point. :)\n\n>It's also possible the laws of the universe - which I would argue ultimately stem from the least action principle, that is itself formulated in terms of the behavior of a presupposed system - are self-organizing and emergent, in that they are imposed through consensus rather than absolution. In that sense maybe there is no underlying structure or meaning beyond what is attributed, and that alone makes it real. Who knows :)\n\nMmmm, it seems unlikely to me that all underlying structure is emergent — after all we seem to have no problem identifying phenomena that appear to be fundamental so far.

It's easiest to understand ""the concentration of water in water"" using mass % or volume %. Two solutions of distilled water are each 100% water, so the concentration in each is just... 100%, by mass or volume. It might be a little counterintuitive because you're used to considering the concentration of something else, like salt or sugar, in water. But if two solutions are both pure water, then their concentration of water is the same.\n\nAs for your second point, I really hate the way people explain diffusion in school, and it tripped me up for a while too. The better way to understand diffusion is like this: there's no force pulling molecules towards an area of low concentration. Each molecule is moving completely randomly, bouncing off of things and getting thrown around by its neighbors. It doesn't know what a ""concentration"" is, and it doesn't care. But if you have a setup with a semipermeable membrane like this:\n\n    A            |           B\n     x  x x  x   |            \n      x x x x x  |        x   \n    x  xx  xx x  |\n\nWhich is more likely: that any one of the 15 Xs crammed into side A will hit the membrane and cross into side B, or that the one lonely little X on side B will find its way to side A? Clearly, there are more Xs on side A, so there are 15 times more opportunities for a particle to cross into side B. And we say that the solution diffuses into side B, though each molecule in it is moving completely randomly.\n\nWhen you have the same number of objects on one side as the other, they're still moving around just as fast, but now there's an equal likelihood of a molecule randomly moving in either direction. So we say our net diffusion is zero, even though the molecules are crossing the boundary at the same rate.",Biology,regarding question different way calculate concentration easiest understand concentration water using mass volume two solution distilled water concentration mass might little counterintuitive used considering concentration something like salt two solution pure concentration water second really hate way people explain diffusion tripped better way understand diffusion like force pulling molecule towards area low molecule moving completely bouncing thing getting thrown around know setup semipermeable membrane like x x x x x x x x x x x xx xx x one x crammed side hit membrane cross side one lonely little x side b find way side x side time opportunity particle cross side say solution diffuses side though molecule moving completely number object one side still moving around equal likelihood molecule randomly moving either say net diffusion even though molecule crossing boundary,0,0,2

The main idea is summed up by Dehaene as:\n\n> When we say that we are aware of a certain piece of information, what we mean is just this: the information has entered into a specific storage area that makes it available to the rest of the brain. Among the millions of mental representations that constantly crisscross our brains in an unconscious manner, one is selected because of its relevance to our present goals. Consciousness makes it globally available to all our high-level decision systems. We possess a mental router, an evolved architecture for extracting relevant information and dispatching it.\n\n> …According to this theory, consciousness is just brain-wide information sharing. Whatever we become conscious of, we can hold it in our mind long after the corresponding stimulation has disappeared from the outside world.

At the instant you light the engine, the power put into the rocket is zero because it’s velocity is zero.   All of the energy actually went into the exhaust gasses moving downward at high speed.  (You can check your instincts about zero power going into the rocket here by asking what would happen if it stayed bolted to the ground).   Then as the rocket accelerates more and more of the power goes into feeding its KE and less and less goes into the downward velocity of the exhaust.

A free proton will never decay because such a process is energetically banned, but bound inside a nucleus, this becomes possible because the energy situation has changed (the mass of the daughter nucleus is less than that of the mother, since nuclear mass is a complex function of number of protons and neutrons). So, similar idea here. The energy conditions strongly suppress or outright ban neutron decay in the star, which can also happen for various nuclei.

You could argue that CO2 capture technology and companies are bad because they might enable fossil fuel use rather than switching over to renewables, so that the government wouldn’t pass legislation that reduced fossil fuel consumption. On a practical level, this type of argument is a reasonable concern, and I think that it’s important to keep in the public discourse around carbon capture. At the same time, direct air capture had the potential to be so valuable in terms of removing historic CO2 emissions that I don’t think we should just ignore it because of its potential to be misused. Another nice side effect of CO2 capture technology is that many of the materials useful for carbon capture are similar to materials used to capture pollutants or toxic elements both from gas streams and water, and these types of small molecule adsorbents might prove to be very good for human and environmental health.",Physics,make good think important recognize carbon capture company sequester carbon rather using energy would making money primarily via government could principle come rely emitted wa worth plant would issue government wa unable pas law required switch clean could argue capture technology company bad might enable fossil fuel use rather switching government pas legislation reduced fossil fuel practical type argument reasonable think important keep public discourse around carbon direct air capture potential valuable term removing historic emission think ignore potential another nice side effect capture technology many material useful carbon capture similar material used capture pollutant toxic element gas stream type small molecule adsorbent might prove good human environmental,0,0,4

From there, the viral genome will remain in the genome until the ""right time"", upon which it will be activated, begin producing viruses, and lyse the cell. This can be long-term and take however long it needs for the viral genes to be activated.\n\nLysing: The virus will override the replication machinery of the host cell, and redirect that machinery to replicating the viral genome instead of the host genome. Tons of viruses will be produced, so many that the cell will literally burst and release tons of other viruses.\n\nNow, there is another possible fate. It could be the case that the viral genome integrates itself into the genome of a cell, but just never gets the chance to ever begin replicating. It just kind of stays there. Then, it's possible that when the host cell replicates its own genome, a mutation will occur in the viral segment of the genome which will render the viral genome useless. If this happens, the mutated (and therefore dysfunctional) viral DNA will sort of just sit there in the host cell DNA forever and the cell will never lyse. There are actually huge portions of our own genome just made of up failed viruses which are now dysfunctional after our cellular replication machinery screwed up when it was trying to carefully replicate their genome. This is not only true for our genome, but true for the genome of virtually every known organism. Even the last universal common ancestor (LUCA) [has a full virome of its own](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-020-0408-x).

If I'm not mistaken, there are actually practical relevances to these failed viruses, such as in organ transplant.

Aerobic organisms derive most of their energy from respiration, which on a cellular level involves the use of O2 and glucose to generate ATP (a ""currency"" of life). CO2 is created as a waste product and must be removed from cells. This occurs by the CO2 diffusing into the blood where (as others have noted) it forms carbonic acid. The blood carries this to the lungs where it's released and diffused across the alveolar membrane in the alveoli and is exhaled. Based on this, if CO2: (1) Was not generated during respiration, very little ATP would be created and the organism would die; (2) CO2 was not carried into the blood, same result; (3) If CO2 levels rise in the blood, pH would change and enzymes would not function correct, resulting in death; (4) Similar scenarios would occur if the CO2 was not taken to the lungs and exhaled. There are more details to this, but this is the essence of what would happen, none of it good.",Biology,please allow restate essential role aerobic organism good aerobic organism derive energy cellular level involves use glucose generate atp created waste product must removed occurs diffusing blood others form carbonic blood carry lung released diffused across alveolar membrane alveolus based wa generated little atp would created organism would wa carried level rise ph would change enzyme would function resulting similar scenario would occur wa taken lung detail essence would none,0,0,1

0x149d,"Regarding your question about concentration:\n\nRead the different ways to calculate concentration here ([https://www.thoughtco.com/definition-of-concentration-605844](https://www.thoughtco.com/definition-of-concentration-605844)). It's easiest to understand ""the concentration of water in water"" using mass % or volume %. Two solutions of distilled water are each 100% water, so the concentration in each is just... 100%, by mass or volume. It might be a little counterintuitive because you're used to considering the concentration of something else, like salt or sugar, in water. But if two solutions are both pure water, then their concentration of water is the same.\n\nAs for your second point, I really hate the way people explain diffusion in school, and it tripped me up for a while too. The better way to understand diffusion is like this: there's no force pulling molecules towards an area of low concentration. Each molecule is moving completely randomly, bouncing off of things and getting thrown around by its neighbors. It doesn't know what a ""concentration"" is, and it doesn't care. But if you have a setup with a semipermeable membrane like this:\n\n    A            |           B\n     x  x x  x   |            \n      x x x x x  |        x   \n    x  xx  xx x  |\n\nWhich is more likely: that any one of the 15 Xs crammed into side A will hit the membrane and cross into side B, or that the one lonely little X on side B will find its way to side A? Clearly, there are more Xs on side A, so there are 15 times more opportunities for a particle to cross into side B. And we say that the solution diffuses into side B, though each molecule in it is moving completely randomly.\n\nWhen you have the same number of objects on one side as the other, they're still moving around just as fast, but now there's an equal likelihood of a molecule randomly moving in either direction. So we say our net diffusion is zero, even though the molecules are crossing the boundary at the same rate.",Biology,regarding question different way calculate concentration easiest understand concentration water using mass volume two solution distilled water concentration mass might little counterintuitive used considering concentration something like salt two solution pure concentration water second really hate way people explain diffusion tripped better way understand diffusion like force pulling molecule towards area low molecule moving completely bouncing thing getting thrown around know setup semipermeable membrane like x x x x x x x x x x x xx xx x one x crammed side hit membrane cross side one lonely little x side b find way side x side time opportunity particle cross side say solution diffuses side though molecule moving completely number object one side still moving around equal likelihood molecule randomly moving either say net diffusion even though molecule crossing boundary,0,0,2

Just a bunch of chemicals, and nothing really exotic.\n\nWe had piperidine, and tetrahydropyrimidine, both smelled somewhere on the bad side of the spectrum. Can't speak much about thiophenol - it was contained safely in a well-corked vial with several layers of polyetylene zip-bags, inside a glass bottle, and all in the fridge at +3 celsius. Whoever had packed it so well was clearly not intended to open it anytime soon.\n\nOxygen compounds have rather pleasant smell - methyl-tert-butyl ether, methyl-isobutyl ketone, 2-hexanone (methyl-butyl ketone). Furfural and furane and tetrahydrofurane (however the last one is borderline pleasant). Monoethanolamine is another one which is at the same time good and bad.\n\nDimethylsulphide is probably bad but we had it very diluted (somewhat 0.1% mass in propane). Dibuthylsulphide, on another hand, we had as a pure substance - and it is not pleasant at all, just believe me.\n\nBut the worst one was not the pure substance but the industrial byproduct (or, rather, residue). A greedy client hired us to determine what good - if any - contain his residues. It were residuals from olefine production, and from that fact you may tell they smelled horribly. He basically had a dozen of railroad tanks of that shit. Lighter products contained mostly butadienes (from which the 1,2-butadiene was the major one, defying thermodynamics), and the rest was a cocktail from hell - butyne-1, butyne-2, vinylacetylene and products of their polymerization. (I learned from literature that vinylacetylene is not only prone to polymerization - but it performs it so eagerly that it often proceeds with explosion. Thankfully, we did not learned that from first-hand experience!). \n\nHeavier fraction was not any better. We analyzed it with the method ASTM D 6730 (with huge red remark that this metod was not developed to determination of composition of so miserable, bad-looking, skunk-smelling devil mixtures). Oh dear. The majority, turns out, was styrene - upto 30%, and it by itself is not the best thing to work - not only it smells horribly, it also may be referred as a liquified cancer.  The rest were various compounds of various degrees of unsaturation, partially polymerized, partially oxidated, and believe me, the entire chromatogram was something to see - and to stick labels to various peaks. The test method had the relative retention times for approx 500 compounds - we found them all (discovered by the way there are some incorrect peaks in the reference table), but we also had several dozens which we can't stick a label to.

0x1dfb,"As others have mentioned, the physical differences in scale often directly lead to differences in chemical properties. In general, as your volume goes up, the surface area/volume ratio of your container decreases, so there will be changes in any area-dependent processes (like heat exchange). Some processes that are fairly straightforward on the bench like filtration or evaporation can become much bigger headaches when scaled up. Something as simple as mixing might take hours instead of minutes- and if you have always mixed a solution for 10 minutes on the benchtop, you might get the nasty surprise that it isn't stable if you mix it for 3 hours.\n\nScale-up often also affects your equipment and the materials involved.

I know that the most fuel efficient trajectory (ignoring gravity assists) between, say, Earth and Mars is a Hohmann transfer orbit. This involves accelerating along the starting orbit to raise the aphelion, which is timed to line up with the target in both space and time. Given our current propulsion technology, a Hohmann transfer or some similar variation is the only feasible trajectory.\n\nWith magic sci-fi engines that can output a high level of constant thrust indefinitely (like 1+ g's), such as the Epstein drive in *the Expanse*, the trajectory becomes a ""flip and burn"" scenario where the spacecraft accelerates toward the target for half the journey, then flips around to decelerate for the second half. Journeys take days rather than months, and the trajectory is nearly a straight line.\n\nThat was a rather long-winded introduction, but my question is the following - imagine a ship has an onboard fusion reactor which powers some form of highly efficient electric propulsion. This lets the ship accelerate essentially indefinitely, but only at a fraction of a g (let's say less than 1 m/s\^2 or even less). **What shape does the optimal trajectory become?** Gravity is no longer ""negligible"" as in the flip and burn scenario, but the journey would still be far faster than a traditional transfer orbit with just a single burn at the start and end.",Physics,question hypothetical spacecraft trajectory destination solar know fuel efficient trajectory gravity earth mar hohmann transfer involves accelerating along starting orbit raise timed line target space given current propulsion hohmann transfer similar variation feasible magic engine output high level constant thrust indefinitely epstein drive trajectory becomes scenario spacecraft accelerates toward target half flip around decelerate second journey take day rather trajectory nearly straight wa rather question following imagine ship ha onboard fusion reactor power form highly efficient electric let ship accelerate essentially fraction g say le even shape doe optimal trajectory gravity longer flip burn journey would still far faster traditional transfer orbit single burn start,0,0,0

0x5b4,"It’s unlikely we could have powered the initial industrial growth via renewable energy, and for the first 100 or so years we didn’t even have that much concern about human emissions causing the planet to warm. Obviously there were still serious issues associated with pollution and also the exploitation of workers and regions that produced oil. \n\nThat said, most of the historical emissions have been after sometime around 1950-1980 when people were already starting to worry about the impact of emissions on the earth’s temperature. In this sense, it is true that we chose to emit greenhouse gases over renewables because of a desire for growth and profit. I’m not sure how developed renewables were at the time, and clearly they were under developed because of a reliance on oil, but renewable energy and battery technology likely weren’t able to replace oil in the 70s or 80s because of how big of a head start oil had. If you look at solar, for example, NREL shows that IBM had one in the 1975 with around 22% efficiency, but the price in the 70s was way higher than it is now to the point where they couldn’t have replaced oil. It also wasn’t merely a profit thing because the high price is associated with a difficulty in manufacturing it in bulk. \n\nAll this aside, you don’t make a compelling case for why we shouldn’t try to capture CO2. Yes, we could have used renewables in the past to avoid CO2 emissions, but that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t try to capture CO2 with plants powered by renewables. Direct air capture from the atmosphere followed by sequestration is one of the few ways that we can reduce the CO2 that already has been emitted. Yes, we can use trees or other natural carbon capturing systems, but carbon capture materials can also play an important role in reducing atmospheric CO2 emissions. \n\nOne important issue with carbon capture and sequestration is that it is incredibly unprofitable (unlike what you said). You spend money capturing something from the atmosphere that is useful (you can burn it to generate energy) and then just bury it underground. You allude to how people want to profiteer off of carbon capture, and I agree with you related to things like capturing carbon from either a coal or natural gas plant and then burning it (this is currently done actually), or capturing it from the atmosphere and then burning it, but the only way carbon capture and sequestration would make you money would be if there were government incentives like a carbon tax or by the government just funding the operation of carbon capture plants.",Physics,unlikely could powered initial industrial growth via renewable first year even much concern human emission causing planet obviously still serious issue associated pollution also exploitation worker region produced historical emission sometime around people already starting worry impact emission true chose emit greenhouse gas renewables desire growth sure developed renewables clearly developed reliance renewable energy battery technology likely able replace oil big head start oil look nrel show ibm one around price wa way higher point replaced also merely profit thing high price associated difficulty manufacturing make compelling case try capture could used renewables past avoid mean try capture plant powered direct air capture atmosphere followed sequestration one way reduce already ha use tree natural carbon capturing carbon capture material also play important role reducing atmospheric important issue carbon capture sequestration incredibly unprofitable spend money capturing something atmosphere useful burn generate bury allude people want profiteer carbon agree related thing like capturing carbon either coal natural gas plant burning currently done capturing atmosphere burning way carbon capture sequestration would make money would government incentive like carbon tax government funding operation carbon capture,0,0,0

If you don‘t understand these things you won‘t really understand chemistry but rather be learning facts. \n\nNow if you know all that stuff or once you‘ve learned that, start with basic things like acid-base chemistry and redox chemistry.

Put the time and effort in to rewrite your CV, making sure to include key words listed on the job posting.

In my professional life, I spent a lot of my time supporting students who were in the same place as you are now, so I can appreciate your concerns.\n\nStudying at University is a big change from school, so you may well find University challenging initially. That’s completely normal. You say you study hard, and I’m sure you do, but perhaps you need to rethink <how> you study. Do you just read through stuff repeatedly? Do you work through practice examples? If you have to do tests, do you work through practice tests? If you have to do essays, do you do practice essays? If you read through stuff, don’t just read it. It’s better to make lists of the main points that the book / website / resource is making, for example. That will help fix it in your memory and identify areas you’re not sure of - you can return to those later.\n\nI’d expect performance to improve as students progress from year to year, because they become more experienced in studying - in other words, their ‘study skills’ improve. In the UK, most universities would run study skills sessions for students, particularly in their first year: I don’t know if sessions like that are available in your institution. If there are, it might be helpful if you took part. How approachable are your tutors? It might also be worth speaking with them and asking their advice.\n\nA very big change to your programme of study needs careful consideration. I suggest you don’t make a switch unless you are VERY sure you want to do it, and can make a list - you might want to type it out - of reasons why it’s a good idea, and why you will ‘cope’ better in that new area.",Biology,thing little principle apply met student range professional spent lot time supporting student place appreciate university big change may well find university challenging completely say study sure perhaps need rethink read stuff work practice work practice practice read read better make list main point book website resource help fix memory identify area sure return expect performance improve student progress year become experienced studying university would run study skill session particularly first know session like available might helpful took approachable might also worth speaking asking big change programme study need careful suggest make switch unless sure want make list might want type reason good better new,0,0,0

0x1896,"Simply put, inertia is the tendency of an object to keep doing what it's doing. Newton's first law of motion is also called the law of inertia commonly said as ""an object in motion stays in motion, and an object at rest stays at rest unless acted upon by an outside unbalanced force."" In classical mechanics, gravity is just another force so if the gravitational force isn't balanced out by some other force then the object will accelerate according to Newton's second law.\n\nYou can also think of inertia as related to mass. It is harder to slow down a train moving at 50 m/s than it is to slow down a ball of paper moving at 50 m/s. And an object moving 1000 km/s in deep space (i.e. away from the influence of other objects' gravity) will continue to move 1000 km/s in the same direction until something changes that. \n\nPhysicists sometimes distinguish between inertial mass and gravitational mass though experimentally they've always been measured to be the same thing. In this case, inertial mass is the mass you see in Newton's second law when written as F=ma and gravitational mass creating the gravitational potential in the equation U = -Gm/r. Inertial mass would relate a force on an object to its overall acceleration whereas gravitational mass determines how much gravity an object has. Though again as far as we can tell they're the same.\n\nInertia also increases without bound as you push an object closer and closer to the speed of light. In other words, it gets harder and harder to speed up an object as you push it closer and closer to the speed of light.\n\nA final note on inertia there's also rotational inertia, which is the rotational analog of mass. Something with a higher moment of inertia is both harder to start spinning and harder to stop spinning. Moment of inertia (the official name for rotational inertia) depends not only on the mass of the object but also the distribution of mass away from the axis of rotation. A simple demonstration to see this is to take a meterstick and twirl it around its center vs trying to twirl it with the same force about one end. It's a lot harder to sping around one end because the mass is on average further away from the axis of rotation.",Physics,simply inertia tendency object keep first law motion also called law inertia commonly said object motion stay object rest stay rest unless acted upon outside unbalanced classical gravity another force gravitational force balanced force object accelerate according second also think inertia related harder slow train moving slow ball paper moving object moving deep space away influence continue move direction something change sometimes distinguish inertial mass gravitational mass though experimentally always measured inertial mass mass see second law written gravitational mass creating gravitational potential equation u inertial mass would relate force object overall acceleration whereas gravitational mass determines much gravity object though far tell also increase without bound push object closer closer speed get harder harder speed object push closer closer speed final note inertia also rotational rotational analog something higher moment inertia harder start spinning harder stop moment inertia official name rotational depends mass object also distribution mass away axis simple demonstration see take meterstick twirl around center v trying twirl force one lot harder sping around one end mass average away axis,0,0,0

And a final tip for this technique would be to avoid disturbing the vial while waiting for it to crystallize. \nThere are other techniques one can try too. You can cool a saturated solution or, as someone mentioned, carefully layer a solvent and anti-solvent (and, if you wish, cool it as well).

0x2533,"The answer to that is kind of complicated, I’m no expert but I’ll do my best to explain. A ceramic is pretty much a 3-dimensional matrix material arranged in a graphitic-type structure. It is generally made of silica and/or carbon mostly but there are plenty of other things that could be inside - mostly inorganic stuff like metals. They have characteristics like no glass transition temperature (which can kind of be thought of as a melting temperature in a layman sense), brittleness (because the chemical structure is highly croslinked and there arent many ways for the molecule to move and deflect energy, so it will simply break instead), heat resistance, and chemical/corrosion resistance. Ceramics can be made in many different ways, but my favorite type of ceramics are polymer-derived ceramics. In this method, you can take a silica based polymer and you basically just heat it up. At first the polymer crosslinks into a 3d shape, locking the shape in place. Then it pyrolyzes, where the less stable molecular structures are broken apart and volatilize out of the material. At high temperatures (like 1300 C) the bonds between the atoms are breaking chaotically and rearranging, and you end up with these carbon-rich domains which are basically graphite (this process is called graphitization) and silica rich domains. There are ways you can control the morphology to dramatically improve certain mechanical properties, but that gets into some complicated stuff.\n\nOh, and Ill add that a cool thing about polymer derived ceramics is that you can 3d print them, which is SUPER valuable for making intricate geometries like rocket engine components.",Chemistry,answer kind expert best ceramic pretty much matrix material arranged generally made silica carbon mostly plenty thing could inside mostly inorganic stuff like characteristic like glass transition temperature kind thought melting temperature layman brittleness chemical structure highly croslinked arent many way molecule move deflect simply break heat ceramic made many different favorite type ceramic take silica based polymer basically heat first polymer crosslinks locking shape le stable molecular structure broken apart volatilize high temperature bond atom breaking chaotically end domain basically graphite process called silica rich way control morphology dramatically improve certain mechanical get complicated ill add cool thing polymer derived ceramic print super valuable making intricate geometry like rocket engine,0,0,1

There are, but ask around and most research got the result first then try to explain the logic behind it.

On top of that bio majors produces the most amount of graduates so you will be competing with these many fuckers for these kind of jobs. \n\n\nThe most mathy Chem class is, of course physical chem and unfortunately it's not there to guide chemical reaction designs yet. It's close I would assume but not there. People would rather swing up a round bottom flask in one hour than computationally investigate a reaction for two days. There's no doubt in silico drug design is a thing but it's not typically something you touch in undergrad, for reference my undergrad at gatech back in 2014 spent one semester of pchem in a 200 ppl class of quant Chem which I can safely say as someone got an A with 60% exam scores, nobody got what the heck was going on. Another semester is wasted in thermodynamics which became absolutely useless. \n\nBiology is even worse in terms of memorization. Ive done 300 level biochemistry and had became a ta in that course involuntarily in grad school and it's all about memorization of stupid cycles that nobody cares.

The closest healthcare job you can get with a chem bs is some guy running hplc in hospitals, and for biology I can't see any. If you like drugs that much, at least try computational drug design. Synthetic chem is arguably an easy way to get into drug design but I don't see it fitting you at all, just find the synthetic Chem labs in your school and talk to the grad kids what they do.

Since you know his mass, 77.1 kilograms, you can solve for his final velocity to determine his momentum upon hitting the ground - which is found by multiplying his mass by his final velocity. The force he experiences upon hitting the ground depends on the time it takes him to come to a full stop. That's because Johnny's change in momentum, which again is mass times velocity, is equal to the impulse he receives from the ground, which is force times time. Therefore, a more drawn out or cushioned impact results in a smaller force.",Physics,gravitational potential energy approximated short flight deck mass time acceleration gravity time height quantity equal kinetic energy johnny ha gained time reach equal since know solve final velocity determine momentum upon hitting ground found multiplying mass final force experience upon hitting ground depends time take come full change mass time equal impulse receives force time drawn cushioned impact result smaller,0,0,0

The bigger the dish, the more energy it can redirect.\n\nIn reverse, a parabolic reflector can also create a “beam” of sound from a point source. This is not amplification, but it does optimise the energy that is there in a particular direction.\n\nAnother aspect is the efficiency of acoustic coupling. A vibrating membrane might have a certain power, but if it’s coupled poorly to the air, it won’t produce much sound. Certain shapes can vastly improve this efficiency. It does not “amplify”, but it does make sure that what energy is there is transferred to the air efficiently. This is the purpose of horns such as on acoustic gramophone players, brass musical instruments, PA speakers, etc. The best shape is an exponential horn that forms a smooth impedance match between the original source of vibration and the air.

If you really want to know more specific details such as where do each wave function comes from and how to write them you'll have to look on a quantum mechanics books, the expressions can get quite extensive.   \nWith that in mind, the squares can be easilly associated with the probability densities (squared wave function), since that is what you'll be seeing the orbital plots, and with some (really large) degree of freedom of speech, try to imagine the xy, xz, zy as solutions where the variables are correlated, justifying the fact that is never purely in the x or y (and so on) axis. For the x\^2 - y\^2 think of them as a linear combination of non-correlated variables to form the general solution, thus the highest probability wont be on a region where the (x\^2 , y\^2) combination is at it's maximum but where either (x\^2 , 0) or (0, y\^2) is being maximized.   \nThe biggest problem with this analogy comes from the z\^2 - r\^2 one, here you'll need to have some revolution solids in mind, since it's quite easy to see that the density regions are separated by a 3-dimensional cone instead of a traditional cartesian axis, that's where the r\^2 may help to visualize its formation. Try plotting a surface such as z\^2 - x\^2 - y\^2 and note that the 3d z\^2 solution lies inside the cone and around it.   \nHowever, do realize, this is just an (way) overly simplified justification, you'll need to check the wavefunction solution for each case to really get a picture of whats going on behind the scene and it's now that hard to find a table of such solutions.

0x853,"First, the argument that they make is not the same as the argument you made (even if their conclusion is similar). They make no mention of the source of the CO2 emissions. They only refer to the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere. At least they understand that what put the CO2 in the atmosphere doesn’t matter. Hopefully you finally agree with this after sharing this link?\n\nSecond, while their conclusion is that the theoretical limit costs more energy to capture carbon than was gained when it was emitted, this directly contradicts the claim made in one of the papers I sent above. That paper claimed that it is theoretically possible (based on thermodynamics) to use a fossil fuel energy source to capture carbon and still have net negative emissions. I’m more inclined to trust the analysis coming from people who specialize in the thermodynamics of gas separations and also who published it on a peer review journal than a post on someone’s substack, even if that person has a PhD in physics. It is possible, however, that the analysis from the 2005 paper represents a theoretical limit that cannot be reached. “Economic and energetic analysis of capturing CO2 from ambient air” (which is cited in the blog post you sent) estimates that with a 5% second law efficiency (they note that real world processes typically have a 5-40% efficiency), the energy costs associated with capturing CO2 from the air is similar to the energy gained from natural gas. If a carbon capture technology were more efficient (and it is theoretically possible for it to be more efficient based on arguments in this same paper), then it would be feasible to power direct air capture with a natural gas plant and still have negative emissions, and if it were powered with renewables then it would be even better in terms of the CO2 reduction. \n\nUltimately, it is true that carbon capture is an energy intensive process. It is not, however, true that the relevant quantity to consider in evaluating the thermodynamics of carbon capture is the energy gained from the initial CO2 emissions. It just so happens that the actual thermodynamic process that is relevant (that of the adsorption and desorption of CO2, which is what I’ve been saying all along) happens to give you a similar amount of energy required for capture as natural gas generates for the same amount of CO2 emitted if you assume that the process has a second law efficiency of 5%. There’s nothing saying the second law efficiency can’t be better than 5%, and also it doesn’t matter that a lot of historic emissions have been from sources besides natural gas (like coal) which emit more CO2 per unit of energy generated. In the argument you were making where the source mattered, these coal emissions would be relevant in addition to other sources. This might seem like a small point, but the main thing we have been discussing is what is the theoretical limit of CO2 capture and what is the relevant thermodynamic process to consider for it, and you were mistaken in thinking the initial emission process was relevant. Perhaps you think that the 5% second law efficiency won’t be bested, in which case the energy use for direct air capture would probably be prohibitive; this is a reasonable thing to believe, and it seems like there are people who are knowledgeable about gas separations who believe it, but it is very different from claiming that direct air capture could never be feasible because the thermodynamics of it could never be favorable. The fact that it could be feasible is why it is a very active topic of research.\n\nEdit: I was looking back through the DAC review article that I initially sent, and wanted to conclude with adding this quotation “Lackner thus concluded that the potential for greater efficiencies with DAC closes the gap in energy requirements between the two processes and suggests that arguments of DAC being unfeasible due to large energy demands compared to flue gas capture may not be accurate.” In the paragraphs following this quotation, the review article discusses different argument made by different papers regarding the energy required in an actual material. They are not all on agreement, and the process is complicated enough that the various approaches from each paper often have drawbacks that could limit the accuracy of their estimates. Clearly, there is debate about the energy requirements of DAC. Some scientists/experts think it the technology won’t be able to get efficient enough, while others think that it can. I don’t think any of the experts think that it is thermodynamically impossible though, just that some think efficiencies might not be able to get close enough to the thermodynamic limit to make DAC reasonably cheap. Hopefully we can both agree on this point, which is different from your initial claim that thermodynamics limits DAC to a point where it couldn’t be feasible no matter how efficient it got.",Physics,argument make argument made conclusion make mention source refer concentration least understand put atmosphere hopefully finally agree sharing conclusion theoretical limit cost energy capture carbon wa gained wa directly contradicts claim made one paper sent paper claimed theoretically possible use fossil fuel energy source capture carbon still net negative inclined trust analysis coming people specialize thermodynamics gas separation also published peer review journal post even person ha phd analysis paper represents theoretical limit cannot energetic analysis capturing ambient cited blog post estimate second law efficiency note real world process typically energy cost associated capturing air similar energy gained natural carbon capture technology efficient theoretically possible efficient based argument would feasible power direct air capture natural gas plant still negative powered renewables would even better term true carbon capture energy intensive true relevant quantity consider evaluating thermodynamics carbon capture energy gained initial happens actual thermodynamic process relevant adsorption desorption saying happens give similar amount energy required capture natural gas generates amount emitted assume process ha second law efficiency nothing saying second law efficiency better also matter lot historic emission source besides natural gas emit per unit energy argument making source coal emission would relevant addition might seem like small main thing discussing theoretical limit capture relevant thermodynamic process consider mistaken thinking initial emission process wa perhaps think second law efficiency case energy use direct air capture would probably reasonable thing seems like people knowledgeable gas separation believe different claiming direct air capture could never feasible thermodynamics could never fact could feasible active topic wa looking back dac review article initially wanted conclude adding quotation thus concluded potential greater efficiency dac close gap energy requirement two process suggests argument dac unfeasible due large energy demand compared flue gas capture may paragraph following review article discus different argument made different paper regarding energy required actual process complicated enough various approach paper often drawback could limit accuracy debate energy requirement think technology able get efficient others think think expert think thermodynamically impossible think efficiency might able get close enough thermodynamic limit make dac reasonably hopefully agree different initial claim thermodynamics limit dac point feasible matter efficient,0,0,4

The tetrahedron and a hexagonal thing. The hexagonal thing is not the simplest unit so it's pretty easy to see why that's not the unit cell. The tetrahedron I actually only see in your description and I'm reasonably certain the reason it doesn't work is that it does not contain enough information or atoms to rebuild the crystal structure. I'm actually not really seeing a tetrahedron. The best tetrahedron I can see is not regular by any stretch of the imagination and definitely won't tesselate to rebuild an entire crystal from that unit. Did you mean octahedron to include all the face centered atoms in the cubic crystal? The issue there is that if you tesselate the object, you'll skip a bunch of atoms. \n\nThe short answer would be that very smart people have worked on this for over a century and the cube is the simplest unit cell that can be tessellated to reproduce the entire crystal structure. If you have an alternate idea for the unit cell, I guarantee your missing something. You either will skip certain atoms when you tessellate, can't tessellate it at all, or you could create an alternate and simpler unit cell that will also work.",Chemistry,expertise answered someone correct seeing alternative cubic unit tetrahedron hexagonal hexagonal thing simplest unit pretty easy see unit tetrahedron actually see description reasonably certain reason work doe contain enough information atom rebuild crystal actually really seeing best tetrahedron see regular stretch imagination definitely tesselate rebuild entire crystal mean octahedron include face centered atom cubic issue tesselate skip bunch short answer would smart people worked century cube simplest unit cell tessellated reproduce entire crystal alternate idea unit guarantee missing either skip certain atom tessellate could create alternate simpler unit cell also,0,0,4

If a species finds a stable niche that doesn't entirely disappear during episodes of mass extinction, it can remain morphologically similar for hundreds of millions of years.\n\nMost selection, at most times, drives species to remain near their local optimum in the fitness landscape. This equilibrium is punctuated by bursts of rapid evolution when the environment changes dramatically and the selection pressures a species is subject to change, or in small isolated populations where genetic drift can mean a random walk across the fitness landscape.\n\nAnd even in species that seem morphologically similar to those that existed hundreds of million years ago, there can be substantial evolution. Most organisms are in a ""Red Queen's"" race with faster evolving parasites and pathogens, so even though their gross appearance may match an unchanging local optimum of the fitness landscape, they probably had major changes to immune response, which wouldn't be visible in the fossile record.\n\nMy understanding is that the nautiluses we find today are scarcely distinguishable from some nautiloids that existed prior to the end Permian mass extinction, and morphologically similar to nautiloids from 500 Mya. Some lampreys haven't changed much in 360 million years.

0xc6e,"So it's a laymen's term and my apologies,  but I try not to get too far into minute details on reddit threads out of fear it won't be fully understood by everyone reading it.\n\nWhen vaccinated, your immune system is ""boosted"" - hence the term ""boost"" or ""booster"" for the vaccine. You get a ""surge"", rapid increase, peak, whatever you want to call it to have it make sense to you (as a virologist, immunologist, entomologist, a new worried father, what have you), shortly after your immune system is stimulated. You would therefore after a vaccination ""booster"" get a ""surge"" or sudden increase in circulating antibodies. In this case for a booster it would be IgG antibodies over IgM, or even in this specific case of a pregnant/post-partum/breast-feeding mother IgA antibodies as it's present in her bodily fluids, but I digress.\n\nThen after a period of time the antibodies go down to almost undetectable levels. There's vast variations in the populations and within individuals, so saying that they go to ""0"" is not entirely accurate. In this day and age with there being no herd immunity, vaccine hesitation and resistance, etc., it's quite possible any particular person may have some level of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies circulating at any point in time. That's why there's ""baseline"" with testing depending on the type of test done and what has been used as a control to establish that test. I've worked in a variety of laboratories and for instance, there's one influenza variant, let's call it variant A, that if your antibody titer is 1:8 or higher, you are considered immune to that virus (1 portion of your serum had enough antibodies present to bind to virus when mixed with blood and diluted at a ratio of 1:8). But let's also say there's another influenza variant, called B, that's a bit more funky, so we consider a titer of 1:16 or 1:32 protective. Or better yet, it's an H5-based influenza virus, in which case it's highly debated if HAI testing is even a good determinant of protective antibody response at all. But again, I digress.\n\nI hope this answered your question somewhat.",Biology,term try get far minute detail reddit thread fear fully understood everyone reading immune system hence term get rapid whatever want call make sense new worried shortly immune system would therefore vaccination get sudden increase circulating case booster would igg antibody even specific case mother iga antibody present bodily period time antibody go almost undetectable vast variation population within saying go entirely day age herd vaccine hesitation quite possible particular person may level antibody circulating point testing depending type test done ha used control establish worked variety laboratory one influenza call variant antibody titer considered immune virus portion serum enough antibody present bind virus mixed blood diluted ratio also say another influenza called bit consider titer better influenza case highly debated hai testing even good determinant protective antibody response hope answered question,0,0,1

However, the other part of the story is metabolism. Metabolism is highly complex and involves many molecular conversions to produce various molecules the body might need at any one instance.  \n\nA scenario where glucose might be converted to fat is eating food when your body already has sufficient energy. If the body has sufficient energy, there is no reason to break it down further to produce energy. Instead, glucose can be converted into glycogen, which is a fuel-storage molecule. \n\nGlycogen stores are limited, but fat stores are virtually infinite, so if you overeat, your body tends to start producing fat stores. For creation of fat stores, glucose is converted into triglycerides (basically fat) and it is stored as fat in your body.",Biology,missing another part macronutrients digested monomer unit absorbed part story metabolism highly complex involves many molecular conversion produce various molecule body might need one scenario glucose might converted fat eating food body already ha sufficient body ha sufficient reason break produce glucose converted store fat store virtually body tends start producing fat creation fat glucose converted triglyceride stored fat,0,0,1

I’m also familiar with safety data sheets and (in the UK the ‘Control of Substances Hazardous to Health’) from my time in labs. Solvents such as amyl acetate (one of the components) can attack some plastics, so probably that component leached through the plastic zip bag. The smell is quite penetrating, so that’s probably what you can smell. I doubt if you will have any adverse effects, as the double bagging would have reduced the amount of solvent escaping considerably. Some people can smell it at lower concentrations than others, but judging from your description it seems unlikely that you had a significant exposure. Faintly smelling it doesn’t sound to me to be a lot if exposure. You can google exposure limits of the different components you’ll see in the safety data sheet for further information.\nKeep your closet door open, and open the window in that room for a while.

Using gloves only when they are necessary is more advisable I think (of course you need to know when you need them and learning to be aware of possible dangers is worth a lot).

Also if people wear gloves they tend to care a lot less if they spill something or not and if they do, they contaminate everything instead of cleaning the mess up immediately. Wearing gloves for a prolonged amount of time also causes sweating and opens the pores, which makes the exposure to chemicals even more dangerous and guess what, gloves also have a time limit on how long they guarantee to withstand different chemicals and people also tend to not care about that and wear gloves for hours.\n\nOf course I dont want to abolish gloves, but I think brainless overuse causes more harm, than it does good.

You don't really input energy into a nuclear reactor. You have fuel rods that will always and constantly give off neutrons. You use neutron moderators, usually coolant as water, to thermalize the neutrons and slow them down. Slower neutrons are more likely to collide with uranium for more reactions. Then you use reflectors and absorbers like beryllium and boron, respectively, to control how many neutrons there are around the fuel rods. At no point did I have to input any energy to cause the uranium to decay and give off neutrons. It's just doing what it would do anyways, and I'm controlling it with external factors. \n\nSo from that standpoint, I think the key things for the chemistry of your fuel rods are factors like density of your actual fuel (ie crystal structure), it's propensity to form cracks during it's lifetime, thermal expansion, etc etc. Even if this couterion neutron capture is an issue, I think it would take a back seat to the other factors and be relatively minor.

Maybe check the o-rings on the port doors, since those can sometimes get dirty and lead to leaks.\n\nAnyway, if you're concerned it's the O2 detector acting up, here's something easy you can do: reduce Cp2TiCl2 with excess zinc powder in toluene. The solution should be quite concentrated. You'll get a dark green solution of the Ti(III) complex. Let a few drops of this solution evaporate on a clean surface, while the blower is turned on. If you get a green residue after the toluene evaporates, your atmosphere has only a few ppm of O2 at most and I would point to your O2 detector being the problem here.

When we set out with a bias, it’s difficult to conduct experiments without bringing that bias along. \nI listened to most of the 300 episodes of a NDE podcast over the last several years. I find it fascinating because everyone’s experience is unique but they all flow very similarly. Regardless of gender, race, location, culture, or creed - people have extremely similar “spiritual” experiences when they experience an NDE or psychoactive compound. Whether it’s LSD where eyes are open, or DMT with closed eyes while seeing more vividly than ever imagined…the experiences are so strikingly similar. With DMT, why would people see the same “entities” even if they’ve never heard reference of them beforehand? I’m not saying that with DMT you go off on an astral trip and meet inter-dimensional beings. But what IS happening? HOW are our humans brains so alike that we hallucinate the exact same ridiculous looking things in an altered state? How have people completely healed themselves from addictions after “meeting Mother Auyhuasca”? How is that we can consume a substance that causes us to dig into the depths of our psyche and rearrange things so that we can function more easily and understand the world more clearly? There is insurmountable evidence if more than a few scientists would study it and if it wasn’t so damn Taboo to talk about. \n\nIt’s precisely because it’s considered woowoo that there isn’t more in-depth research on the topic or at least not that the public is allowed to know about. It’s precisely why psilocybin, DMT, LSD, and even cannabis have been deemed schedule 1 drugs. Because it usually changes the way we see the world. It usually causes us to “wake up”, from this dumb broken system we’ve created. Why does it do that? Well, we don’t really NEED to understand the why to see that it does, regardless of our understanding. But I do believe we will understand it better someday. Whatever it is, it IS scientific and it just IS the way things are. Either we as humans have the ability to hallucinate the same experiences and exact images as strangers across the globe, or it’s a spiritual experience suggesting that there is way more than just this earthly plane of existence. It’s one of those two things and they are both really freaking cool. If science helps discover the truth, and if spirituality is also the truth, then I expect in the future we will come to accept that they complement each other well. But there is no room for religion (not even the “religion” of faith in science, because it’s still done by man’s hand) when it comes to progress. \n\nObserve and wonder. We don’t need to know all the answers. Aside from the fact that no one is burning in Hell for eternity. 😉\n\nGood chat, you’re cool.

At this point you are asking things that are explained in middle school science classes before they even call the class chemistry, or at least my middle school called it Science class.  A gas has atoms less densely packed than a liquid or solid.  A nebulizer  uses an atomizer to disperse the drug and in turn and intrinsically turns it into a gas or at least decreases the droplet size small enough to be inhaled without choking.  The less mass something has the less effect gravity has on it.  Something under about 80nm is uneffected by gravity.  Although the droplets are larger than this they do have such little mass at those sizes that they are temporarily suspended in air.  This is essentially a fog not steam.  Of course steam is acting on similar principles and is also lifted into the air by thermodynamics. Speaking of your earlier example of liquids those are suspensions in liquids usually mostly water with some flavoring to make it easier to swallow whereas a nebulizer or inhaler is a suspension in air. Gases mix homogeneously without even mixing like a liquid.  At this point it is getting a bit difficult to explain to you because you are requiring an explanation of underpinnings that should be understood and implied.  Again see basic chemistry and physics.

Both nymphs and adults are generalist predators that feed on a variety of insects including aphids, caterpillars, bugs, beetles, and more. The bug uses its stout beak to inject the prey insect with a toxin that kills it within 30 seconds. Most of their prey are pest insects so they are considered beneficial to farmers and gardeners. They move slowly and are clumsy fliers. Their bite has been described as being more painful than a wasp sting so they should be admired but not handled\n\nRead more at: https://growingsmallfarms.ces.ncsu.edu/2020/04/birth-assassin-bug/",Biology,look like assassin wheel arilus north largest assassin get name prominent spiny found nymph adult generalist predator feed variety insect including bug us stout beak inject prey insect toxin kill within prey pest insect considered beneficial farmer move slowly clumsy bite ha described painful wasp sting admired,0,0,1

0x2594,"So far people commenting are forgetting about *length contraction*: If I'm moving at relativistic speeds, in my reference frame the distance between where I start and where I end up shrinks. Time is still passing for me, but the distance I travel approaches zero as I get closer to the speed of light. At the speed of light, then, the distance *is* zero. Better, points at lightlike separation are a distance zero from each other in the Minkowski metric.\n\nThe implication that confuses the OP, then, is that this means that, in the reference frame of a photon, it exists for only an instant: It is instantaneously transmitted from its origin to its destination, and thus in its frame *no time passes*. In our frame of course it takes time for the light to move, because light doesn't move infinitely fast and the distance between its origin and its destination *isn't* zero. In the photon's frame that distance *is* zero. This is indeed strange, for it says that a photon ""sees"" the universe as flat, with all distances parallel to its direction of travel shrunk to zero; and as far as the photon is concerned it seems not to exist for any time at all.\n\nTo that all I can say is that photons aren't people; they seem to get along with their weird lives with little worry. I don't exactly want to make the excuse that I'm a physicist and not a philosopher, since understanding the ontology is important for the physics, but it is true that special relativity works.

0x1937,"Okay so this is a tough question, let me try to bring some light to it.\nSo, the issue here lies with the interpretation on Quantum Mechanics. QM postulates describe how do systems work. They are true (as far as we know), but they don't give a further explanation as to why is the world like this. These postulates describe how measurements are performed by an observer on a quantum system. The measurement collapses the wave function at the moment of the measurement. And the instants before and after the measurement, the system can go back to its usual probabilistic behaviour. However, what does it mean to perform a measurement? The measurement gives a concrete value to a magnitude (it could be energy, speed, position... of the system). Usually, we consider collisions between particles or semiparticles to be measurements, since, in the limit, they are two different systems that interact and preserve the energy and momentum equations(if they are coupled we cannot apply it but for the sake of our argument we'll toss it under the carpet). So, in these cases, even if there's no evident observer, there is indeed a measurement performed in the systems. \nThis means that you don't need to have intelligent observer to collapse a wavefunction.\n\nHowever, if we say the whole universe is a closed system that has a huuuuuge wave function, one could argue that there are only partial observations but the whole universe wavefunction isn't collapsed. Then, you could say that everything is in a quantum state and is in fact governed by qm laws as a wave. What happens with all the other possible discarded states (universes in this case) is a bigger question that has no answer and that messes with the interpretations of qm.\n\nTL;DR: we don't need intelligent observers to collapse wave functions, the universe is and will be a quantum state\n\nHope it was useful:)",Physics,okay tough let try bring light issue lie interpretation quantum qm postulate describe system true far give explanation world like postulate describe measurement performed observer quantum measurement collapse wave function moment instant system go back usual probabilistic doe mean perform measurement give concrete value magnitude could consider collision particle semiparticles two different system interact preserve energy momentum coupled cannot apply sake argument toss even evident indeed measurement performed mean need intelligent observer collapse say whole universe closed system ha huuuuuge wave one could argue partial observation whole universe wavefunction could say everything quantum state fact governed qm law happens possible discarded state bigger question ha answer mess interpretation need intelligent observer collapse wave universe quantum wa,0,0,1

(hence the comparison of distance to xenon and radon is a bit inaccurate) A very important aspect is the inert pair effect of s-electrons. It simply states that as you go to higher rows, e. g within the 3rd main group from boron to aluminium to gallium to indium and finally to thallium, the s-electrons become increasingly more difficult to access. The effect originates from quantum mechanics. This means in essence that the tendency of being most stable in the +I compared to the +III state increases with increasing mass of the element. In other words, removing both s-electrons from the valence shell of thallium is more difficult than for indium, gallium, aluminium or boron. (The same trend applies also to the 4th and somewhat to the 5th main group) Negative oxidation states are for  elements of the 3rd main group exceedingly rare, because their electromegativities are relatively low. This means that the valence shell of thallium for example is barely capable of accommodating one additional electron. negatively charged thallium ions are therefore rarely formed.

In (2) we have a new d.o.f. φ [...] What should the expectation for a cosmological evolution of ϕ be? The MOND law for galaxies is silent regarding this matter. There is, however, another empirical law which concerns cosmology: the existence of sizable amounts of energy density scaling precisely as a^(−3).\n\nIn other words, they are saying that to get the cosmology right, they need to add dark matter -- that is what they are alluding to with the ""sizable amounts of energy"". They make their φ field play this role. It's just like TeVeS, the other major relativistic MOND theory, where the scalar ""S"" field does the same thing.\n\nThe popular press likes to frame the debate as ""dark matter vs. modified gravity"", but it's really ""dark matter vs. dark matter plus modified gravity"". The hope is that adding a modification of gravity will help fit the galaxy rotation curves better, at the cost of higher theoretical complexity. If you read the paper, the authors aren’t trying to do away with dark matter at all — their primary achievement is getting their modified gravity theory to work out despite the many theoretical obstacles.\n\n---\n\nEdit: I also feel like I should respond to the other top comment which complains modifying gravity is ""less elegant"" than dark matter. These days, dark matter models are not about elegance at all, they're about minimality: trying to account for it by adding just one or two kinds of particles, with the simplest possible interactions, focusing on the dumbest possible first guess. There was an era where people to make dark matter ""elegantly"" fall out as a secondary consequence of adding 100 new particles in a grand theory that also solved every other problem in the Standard Model at once, but that ship has sailed because those theories didn't work.

Generally I'd say the quote as stated is not wrong (it's imprecise, as it is a statement in words and not one in mathematics, but it's at least not wrong). \n\nThere are situations where a quantum system is in only one state. We might not know in what state it is, but it's definitely in one and only one state.\n\nIn other situations a quantum system can be in a superposition of multiple states (that can be all possible states, it can also be only two of many possible states). A superposition of multiple states is what popular science calls ""in many states at once"" (one can definitely discuss how accurate this description is, but I think it's the most accurate, non-mathematical, description one can give). If you measure such a superposition state you will however only observe one of the states that made up the superposition (much like the example of the cat, that's why I said: if a cat was a quantum system the example would be true).\n\nWhich of the two situations apply, depends on your experimental setup. The important thing is that the measurement statistics of these two situations are different. If you give me a quantum system, and don't tell me whether it's in one state (but don't tell me which) or whether it's in a superposition af multiple states, I will be able to tell.

0x1f5c,"Okay that makes more sense to me. In that case, it's either a kinetic or thermodynamic thing. It's probably not kinetic but just in case, you could try cooling it more slowly. Idk what the water content is in the microwave so either inject it into hot water and let cool or let it cool and then inject it into the regular water. I don't think this will work but maybe.\n\nOtherwise, the issue seems to be one of partitioning. You have 2 phases, either stearic acid in the SLN or the lipid tails of the tween 20. As is, they are virtually identical. Both are totally unsaturated long carbon chains. Could you try altering composition of the lipid core to make a more distinct difference in phase? Clotrimazole is highly aromatic so while it will dissolve in aliphatic substances, it should still prefer aromatic substances. If you can up the aromatic content of your SLN, it might stay in place more. Aromatic body friendly things seem rare though. Cholesterols or some unsaturated fats maybe? Some vitamin B's or E look promising. Tryptophan might even work. \n\nCome to think of it, the whole thing is weird to me. It's a little weird that you have SLN's and micelles both existing. It seems like there's just too much surfactant as it means your covering the SLN's entirely and still have enough left over to be above the cmc. But the other bit that's weird is that a drug dissolved in a SOLID lipid core is partitioning into the micelle phase. If it's solid, it shouldn't really move and definitely not partition into a micelle phase. So... kinetics might not actually be far off. I was thinking of micelle formation before but you might need to worry about the SLN formation. If you can get the SLN's formed before diluting, you should be golden. But I'm guessing that's the whole cold water step and it will fail otherwise. I'm kind of curious what happens if you just microwave the drug and stearic acid by themselves and then inject them straight into water. It will fall out of solution, but if it forms the right sized particles, you might be able to add your tween 20 after the fact and with some mixing and/or sonication, resuspend the stearic acid mixture. Even if you are forming micelles, it should be solid already and avoid the issue. But it might not form the right size particles or resist resuspension. Who knows? Concentration is still probably the best bet.",Chemistry,okay make sense either kinetic thermodynamic probably kinetic could try cooling idk water content microwave either inject hot water let cool let cool inject regular think work issue seems one either stearic acid sln lipid tail tween virtually totally unsaturated long carbon could try altering composition lipid core make distinct difference clotrimazole highly aromatic dissolve aliphatic still prefer aromatic aromatic content might stay place aromatic body friendly thing seem rare cholesterol unsaturated fat vitamin e look tryptophan might even think whole thing weird little weird micelle seems like much surfactant mean covering entirely still enough left bit weird drug dissolved solid lipid core partitioning micelle really move definitely partition micelle kinetics might actually far wa thinking micelle formation might need worry sln get formed guessing whole cold water step fail kind curious happens microwave drug stearic acid inject straight fall form right sized might able add tween fact mixing resuspend stearic acid even forming solid already avoid might form right size particle resist concentration still probably best,0,0,1

A tesseract, as it's called, is simply a small cube centered within a larger cube with the vertices connected. From our perspective, the cubes are not equal sizes and the connection points are not equal to the sides of the squares, but regardless of our perception, it is a perfectly equilateral object in the 4th dimension, and each face is its own cube. We know this because, in order to create a 4th dimensional cube (tesseract), you would have to take 3D cubes and seperate them equally across a brand new direction, one that does not exist in our reality (just like ""up"" and ""down"" are brand new directions that do not exist in the reality of the Flat Worlder).\n\nMy point is, a virtual reality experience of the 4th dimension would still be grounded in the 3rd, because that's all we can experience.

If we observe the photons, then only go through one slit and we don’t really see a defraction grating but if we leave the system unobserved we see the wave/particle duality. This is when the particle goes through both slits. Actually Schrödinger’s cat was made by him as an example of how ridiculous the probabilistic approached QM is…but it actually is a good example which is ironic.

Your DNA is inside the nucleus of the cell and whenever something needs to be expressed, a copy of the DNA is made and then transported out of the nucleus.

0x27a3,"You make some fair points, but I’m a little unsure about your main argument. \n\nAre you saying that all of the energy gained from the past 100-150 years of burning fossil fuels would have to be used to capture the CO2 in the atmosphere, and that we won’t be able to generate that much energy because we will also have to be powering society with renewables? If this isn’t what you’re saying, then I just misunderstood, but as far as I’m aware, I don’t think that this is right. \n\nFirst, over time we have been gradually getting more energy for the amount of emissions that are produced. Natural gas flue streams have much less CO2 than coal streams, making carbon capture from them more difficult (you allude to this in your comment above), but also meaning that we could be getting more energy per emissions out of natural gas than coal. I don’t know if the natural gas gives less energy than coal so it balances out to be the same energy per emissions (if so, I would be interested in seeing a source on this). Also, either way I agree we shouldn’t be using fossil fuels for energy. I’m not a “clean coal” or natural gas advocate. \n\nSecond, different materials require different energy inputs to adsorb and to release CO2. It’s not a fixed cost for every material. I can’t tell if I’m missing some basic thermodynamic argument for why the energy cost to capture must equal the energy cost to release, because we aren’t trying to “unburn the coal.” Initially we had coal -> energy and CO2, but now we are trying to go from CO2 -> something that isn’t coal.

Your DNA is inside the nucleus of the cell and whenever something needs to be expressed, a copy of the DNA is made and then transported out of the nucleus. When it's transported out, it's the mRNA form. It's the same here, except being made in the cell's nucleus, it's introduced via a shot. As far as I know, it's the same mechanism that stops excessive expression.\n\nHmm.. so I'm not an expert, but this doesnt sound right. the mRNA isn't anything but a message for your body. Your body uses that message to produce proteins that the rest of your body will then fight off. I think the concern is that there's no way to control the amount of proteins your body creates so SOME people create a massive amount of proteins which end up collecting in certain parts of the body. \n\nWhat is ""excessive expression""?\n\n>There's nothing to support that.

It is different from other meal moth species, including the common meal moth, Pyralis farinalis. Adults are tricolored above, wavy patterned below, and with the tiny abdomen tip held at about 90 degrees to body plane. Now pantropical (and in warm temperate regions), it may have originated in Central America.\n\nTheir diet is unusually broad, including grains and many foods made with at least some grain including cereals, breads, muffins, pasta, pet food, bird seed, but apparently also some nuts, candy bars, peanut butter, possibly starches such as corn starch, tapioca, etc.\n\nThe peak adult activity is around dusk. During daytime the adults mostly remain inactive in dark spots (e.g. crevices). Adults are moderately attracted to light, especially in the blue to violet range.\n\nThey are readily detectable using pheremone traps (scented tent-traps). Deter them by using airtight, adequate  food containers or double bagging, as well as using essential oils and nontoxic pantry moth spray. All stages including eggs are readily killed in a short time by temperatures over c. 130°F (e.g. in a car in the sun on a hot day) or freezing for 72 hours.\n\nUnlike most meal moths, the larvae of this species readily chew through paper, some plastics including processed-cereal freshness liners, and even thin cardboard.

0x98b,"1.The fact that he's young and healthy doesn't necessarily mean COVID won't hit him hard. Plus, the more people are vaccinated the better because the virus won't be able to transmit so easily, replicate and MUTATE. So we are more likely to get worse COVID variants if there are not enough people vaccinated. Not to mention there's a higher chance that he will spread it to his grandma or something. \n\n2. I honestly can't think how you can hit an artery in the upper arm muscle? Or even a major blood vessel.   But let's assume the vaccine goes straight into the blood stream. Nano-lipid particles are quite fragile. They're often covered in PEG to even make them stay longer in the bloodstream otherwise they would get opsonised and eaten by macrophages quickly. In order for these nano-lipids to ""enter every cell of the body"" they would have to extravasate from the blood stream and that wouldn't be so easy either (not to mention there wouldn't be enough of them to enter every cell). Usually people rely on cancer vasculature to be more ""leaky"" and try to use liposomes as drug carriers for instance. Because they would in theory accumulate in tumour. Probably the worst case scenario if by some miracle you injected the vaccine into the bloodstream would be that you might not develop an immunological memory for COVID or feel a bit worse. Even if mRNA entered some other cells, they would just start producing this spike protein. And sure, the immune cells would destroy these ""infected"" cells but there's nowhere near enough mRNA injected to cause any real damage that way (especially if it's dispersed and ""diluted"" in your body in this scenario). So essentially in the muscle the cells will start producing the spike protein (which is not secretory because some people wrongly suggest that you have a lot of this protein accumulated in your body), the immune cells such as dendritic cells (DCs) would find it, carry it to lymph nodes and activate T cells and B cells. There are a lot of DCs in the muscle so it's a great place to inject a vaccine. \n\n3. I honestly can't see how an mRNA vaccine can mess up your immune system and make it not work properly.

In this metaphor, there is no such thing as a consciousness particle or consciousness field but rather it emerges when you reach some critical threshold of interacting neurons.\n\nHe also uses some subtle arguments relating to the trade offs between a given force (gravity, EM) and its reach of influence. If a consciousness force could affect the brain, it would have to be certainly much stronger than gravity and we’ve never detected such a force.\n\nI do agree this is likely beyond his field of expertise, but I don’t fault him (or anyone) for positing claims beyond their strict academic domain.",Biology,think emergent property least heard sean carroll say something similar physicist view emergent property statistical thing temperature single pressure single rather macroscopic property accurately modeled emerging many trillion kinetic collision thing consciousness particle consciousness field rather emerges reach critical threshold interacting also us subtle argument relating trade offs given force reach consciousness force could affect would certainly much stronger gravity never detected agree likely beyond field fault positing claim beyond strict academic,0,0,1

The numbering follows the one of Fischer's projections, being 1-sn the carbon at the top and 3-sn the one at the bottom.\n\nThe advantage of this particular notation is that the spatial configuration (D or L) of the glycero-molecule is determined intuitively by the residues on the positions sn-1 and sn-3.\n\nFor example sn-glycero-3-phosphoric acid and sn-glycero-1-phosphoric acid are enantiomers.\n\nMost vegetable oils have unsaturated fatty acids in the sn-2 position, with saturated fatty acids in the 1-sn and/or 3-sn position.[5] Animal fats more often have saturated fatty acids in the 2-sn, with unsaturated fatty acids in the 1-sn and/or sn3 position.[5]",Chemistry,glycerophospholipids use stand stereospecific letter appear convention hydroxyl group second carbon glycerol left fischer numbering follows one carbon top one advantage particular notation spatial configuration determined intuitively residue position example acid acid vegetable oil unsaturated fatty acid saturated fatty acid animal fat often saturated fatty acid unsaturated fatty acid,0,0,4

0xaf3,"My knowledge of the nutrition literature is very sketchy further back than the year 2000.\n\nThe 9 essential amino acids were known by the 1940s. Its the same 9 essential amino acids for humans, cows, chickens, and *all* animals. No animal is an essential amino acid producer, they're all ""middlemen"". In evolution, creatures that evolved to eat plants or other animals lost the same set of metabolic pathways early, over 1000 million years ago.\n\nNutritional requirements for protein have become better defined with time. I'd recommend the WHO's [Protein and Amino Acid Requirements in Human Nutrition](http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/43411/WHO_TRS_935_eng.pdf;jsessionid=42513E10FE32E690D087BCDF2725806C?sequence=1), from 2007, for the still current consensus.\n\nThe requirements are fairly fixed by lean body mass, and its still common for some elderly to fall short, mostly because they're sedentary and eat so few calories in total that the dietary proportions that served them in youth no longer provide enough protein to support immune function. There's no requirement for the elderly to consume animal products, but for those who consume fewer calories in total, the requirement for protein may rise from the \~10% of calories required in younger people to 15-20% of calories. The additional protein could come from eggs & cheese, or from legumes and tofu.\n\nThere was an [interesting paper from 2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S155041311400062X) which found mild protein restriction was associated with protection against chronic disease and mortality, but only up to age 65 to 70. After that, higher protein intake in the 10-20% range improved survival. I think in this study we're seeing both some benefit from mild protein restriction in preventing cardiovascular and metabolic disease in middle age, and also a benefit of ensuring enough protein for our immune cells to proliferate in response to infection, in the elderly.\n\nI eat a plant based diet for health, and became fascinated with the nutrition and health literature about a decade ago. Because plant based diets can be unbalanced, I was concerned about the essential amino acids likely to be deficient. The key requirement for  is 30 mg/kg/day of lysine, and 15 mg/kg/day for methionine + cysteine (from table 49 of the WHO document cited above). Meet those, and its pretty much assured the other essential amino acids will be adequate. In practice, it generally means most plant based eaters need 2-3 servings of legumes daily, to ensure adequate lysine. People with weirder diets, like alcoholics, may need more protein heavy foods.",Biology,knowledge nutrition literature sketchy back year essential amino acid known essential amino acid animal essential amino acid creature evolved eat plant animal lost set metabolic pathway million year requirement protein become better defined recommend amino acid requirement human still current requirement fairly fixed lean body still common elderly fall mostly sedentary eat calorie total dietary proportion served youth longer provide enough protein support immune requirement elderly consume animal consume fewer calorie requirement protein may rise calorie required younger people additional protein could come egg legume wa paper found mild protein restriction wa associated protection chronic disease age higher protein intake range improved think study seeing benefit mild protein restriction preventing cardiovascular metabolic disease middle also benefit ensuring enough protein immune cell proliferate response eat plant based diet became fascinated nutrition health literature decade plant based diet wa concerned essential amino acid likely key requirement methionine cysteine table document cited meet pretty much assured essential amino acid generally mean plant based eater need serving legume ensure adequate people weirder like may need protein heavy,0,0,1
