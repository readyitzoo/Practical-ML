0x840,"A few things. You might have negative- frequency dependent selection going on where the least common phenotype, reflected by genotype, is going to have an advantage in the environment. For instance, if a prey animal such as a vole were to have a light and a dark phenotype, a predator might recognize the more common phenotype as food.  So if the light voles are more common, foxes may be keeping a closer eye out for light phenotypic voles, recognising them as good prey. This would reduce the light causing alleles due to increased predation and the dark genotypes would increase their proportion of the population until this scenario is reversed. This cycle continues perpetually. \n\nHowever, this is unlikely to be strictly yearly as it usually takes more time than a year for an entire populations allele frequencies to change enough to make a large enough difference to alter fitness. \n\nMore likely on a *year to year* basis, the population is experiencing fluctuating selection where alternating conditions in the environment favor one genotype over another. Perhaps a plant species is living in an area that is flooded every other year and the two phenotypes in the population are plants that do much better in the dryer year and one that does better in the wet year. If there is no flooding, the dry-type genotype will have more fitness leading to more offspring and therefore more dry alleles in the population, however, in flooded years the wet-liking phenotype will do better and propagate the wet genes.",Biology,a few things you might have negative frequency dependent selection going on where the least common phenotype reflected by genotype is going to have an advantage in the environment for instance if a prey animal such as a vole were to have a light and a dark phenotype a predator might recognize the more common phenotype as food  so if the light voles are more common foxes may be keeping a closer eye out for light phenotypic voles recognising them as good prey this would reduce the light causing alleles due to increased predation and the dark genotypes would increase their proportion of the population until this scenario is reversed this cycle continues perpetually nnhowever this is unlikely to be strictly yearly as it usually takes more time than a year for an entire populations allele frequencies to change enough to make a large enough difference to alter fitness nnmore likely on a year to year basis the population is experiencing fluctuating selection where alternating conditions in the environment favor one genotype over another perhaps a plant species is living in an area that is flooded every other year and the two phenotypes in the population are plants that do much better in the dryer year and one that does better in the wet year if there is no flooding the drytype genotype will have more fitness leading to more offspring and therefore more dry alleles in the population however in flooded years the wetliking phenotype will do better and propagate the wet genes,0,0,2

There is good agreement in the so-called solar parameters between solar oscillations measured by SNO, Borexino, SuperK, and others with long-baseline reactor measurements by KamLand. The former measurement will improve considerably with DUNE and the latter with JUNO. The so-called atmospheric parameters show even more impressive agreement with atmospheric measurements by SuperK and IceCube, long-baseline accelerator measurements by MINOS, NOvA, and T2K, and medium baseline reactor measurements by Daya Bay and RENO. This paints a clear picture that neutrinos oscillate which guarantees that at least two of them have mass.\n\nWhat does that mass look like from a model building point of view? The fact that there are lots of options is exactly why neutrinos represent the biggest open questions in particle physics. They almost certainly have a Dirac mass term from a Yukawa coupling to the Higgs field, same as the rest of the fermions. This guarantees at least two new gauge singles (i.e. right handed sterile neutrinos). The story is obviously more complicated than that since we don't know if lepton number is a good symmetry.

0xb94,"I agree with most of what you said up there, though the effects of greenhouse gases on the atmosphere and the temperature of the planet were known as early as the second decade of the 20th century. And, yes, hydrocarbons have been awesome for rocketing humanity into the 21st century. But we aren't changing today. We know. We know what is happening to our planet, the science is solid and incontrovertible. And yet, our carbon production is growing every year. This year is more than last year, and that was more than the year before, and so on. Saying that we can use renewables to capture carbon in the future sounds great. But it ignores the fact that we are not using renewables to replace carbon producing energy industries today. This is a diffusion of focus. Articles like this (including that awesome Icelandic carbon capture machine that was profiled so ubiquitously a month ago) are distracting us from our immediate need. We must reduce our carbon production today. There is no other (top) priority, and every one of these 'science will fix it' distractions only reduce the impetus for change. This is doubly true when you look at the minutiae of these schemes. The energy required to remove carbon from the atmosphere is more than the energy gain from putting it in there.

0x235a,"Here’s a lengthy quote where you rejected that claim I made above. \n\n““>The fundamental point is that when it comes to capturing carbon, the way the CO2 was generated doesn’t affect the energy required to capture it at all. [I said this, and you rejected this claim in the following]\n\nIf you mean:  the amount of energy required to re-uptake the CO2 from the atmosphere has no relation to the energy that was spent in releasing and mixing the CO2 into the atmosphere, then you're very simply wrong about this.  \n\n... \n\nregardless of the ""implementation"" of the process, man-made or natural, it is absolutely the case that when you mix the CO2 into the atmosphere, \_energy is spent\_.  And if that CO2 is taken back, energy is spent again, and the amount on this ""uptake"" is \_necessarily at least as much as on the first mixing\_ --- *in practice*, it's a lot more.   This is very straightforward thermodynamics -- it's why and how a perpetual motion machine is impossible.  \n\n\nPerhaps I've mislead you by letting out, early on, an air that this relation between the energies is somehow 1-to-1, when it's not -- for example, when you burn a log, depending on your furnace etc, ""only"" about 15-30% of the energy released by the burn goes into heating the exhaust flue (and is thereby a component of the ""issue with entropy"" that the fart was originally about).  If I let the impression that 100% does, then it's my mistake.  HOWEVER, the energetics and thermodynamics of releasing that exhaust into the atmosphere is *still* such that I say confidently: you would have to use \_at least\_ the energy equivalent to that of burning the original log to get the exhaust back. “\n\n[End of your quote. If you don’t feel like reading all of this, I would encourage you to just think about what I say at the very end of this comment regarding the way you seem to think you understand the thermodynamics of the situation better than published experts in this field whose views I have explicitly cited in my argument] \n\nIn the above, you pretty clearly said that you thought that the amount of the energy gained was relevant in determining the thermodynamic feasibility. It is not. You now seem to be claiming that instead you were just hoping to estimate the amount of energy that would be required to capture the carbon, but it is also not useful as an estimate of how much energy would be required (even if it just so happens to be close if you assume all of the emissions were via natural gas, but there’s no reason to assume all emissions are from natural gas). The blog post that you sent does not care at all about the source. All that I’ve been trying to argue is that the energy gained from the CO2 source does not matter. It seems like maybe you now agree with this claim, or perhaps you agreed with it all along. \n\nTo assess the thermodynamic feasibility of carbon capture, you have to have to carry out a pretty involved modeling of the capture process. Any such model will make assumptions which other experts may or may not agree with, which is why there are a range of estimates for the energy cost. It is made especially difficult to estimate because we don’t actually know what the efficiency of future technology will be, so any estimate that relies on taking some thermodynamic limiting case and then estimating the energy expenditure of a real life material by guessing some efficiency as a percentage of the thermodynamic limiting case will be highly dependent on what someone guesses for the efficiency. As I mentioned above, the direct air capture article that I referred you to mentions how a typical efficiency range can be from 5-40%. Depending on how efficient researchers are able to make a material, it could end up being energetically worthwhile. There is no thermodynamically determined limit that guarantees carbon capture will use too much energy to make it worthwhile. Again, I wonder why you are so insistent that I am wrong about this? At this point I’ve summarized several journal articles about carbon capture, and they agree with what I’m saying. That carbon capture review article is what gave me the impression you were incorrect in the first place (I read it a long time ago). It’s one thing for you to say that me, a random redditor whose background you know nothing about is wrong, but why is it that you’re so sure you understand carbon capture better than experts in the field that I’ve cited?\n\nEdit: \nAlso, when you said this it confused me:\n“>your initial claim that thermodynamics limits DAC to a point where it couldn’t be feasible no matter how efficient it got.\n\nShow me where I've said that DAC is impossible, instead of unfeasible, or -- pretty please -- shut up.  Intentional misrepresentation is *not* civil.”\n\nIn the post where you quoted me I said “[you] claim that ... DAC ... couldn’t be feasible no matter how efficient it got” and then you tell me to “shut up” for saying that you said that “DAC is imposible instead of unfeasible.” I’m very confused by what caused your aggressive response. As far as I can tell, I’m this part where you quoted me I’m saying that you claimed DAC was unfeasible? If you think that when I said “couldn’t be feasible” this was meant to be synonymous with “impossible” rather than “unfeasible,” then either you’ve misread what I wrote or I wrote it poorly. In either case, I was not trying to intentionally misrepresent what you said. I apologize if it came off like that, and I’m also sort of surprised by your hostile tone here.\n\nTo clarify what I meant by ""Hopefully we can both agree on this point, which is different from your initial claim that thermodynamics limits DAC to a point where it couldn’t be feasible no matter how efficient it got,"" what I was trying to say is that my impression of what you have been saying is something like ""thermodynamics limits the energy efficiency of carbon capture in a way that no matter how efficient carbon capture technology got, it would not be energetically feasible because the minimum energy required to capture carbon would be too high to make it worthwhile."" It's clear that it is possible for people to capture CO2 from the air since there are already plants that do this, what I meant regarding the possibility or feasibility of it had to do with whether or not the energy cost would render direct air capture a practical way to reduce the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. I think that practical is likely a better word than ""possible"" or ""feasible"" or whatever else, and I probably expressed what I was saying in an unclear way, but I hope from context it was clear what I meant.\n\nPerhaps what I wrote expressed the sentiment that I was trying to convey poorly; you were rather ungenerous to me in assuming that I was trying to put words in your mouth as a rhetorical trick to ""win"" the argument. In any discussion like this, it is obviously important for both people to understand what the other person is saying, and sometimes people misunderstand each other. If you think that I misrepresented what you were saying, I apologize again and I assure you that I wasn't doing so intentionally. Additionally, it is a little bit ironic that I now feel that you've misrepresented me when you said that I intentionally misrepresented you.",Physics,heres a lengthy quote where you rejected that claim i made above nnthe fundamental point is that when it comes to capturing carbon the way the co2 was generated doesnt affect the energy required to capture it at all i said this and you rejected this claim in the followingnnif you mean  the amount of energy required to reuptake the co2 from the atmosphere has no relation to the energy that was spent in releasing and mixing the co2 into the atmosphere then youre very simply wrong about this  nn nnregardless of the implementation of the process manmade or natural it is absolutely the case that when you mix the co2 into the atmosphere _energy is spent_  and if that co2 is taken back energy is spent again and the amount on this uptake is _necessarily at least as much as on the first mixing_  in practice its a lot more   this is very straightforward thermodynamics  its why and how a perpetual motion machine is impossible  nnnperhaps ive mislead you by letting out early on an air that this relation between the energies is somehow 1to1 when its not  for example when you burn a log depending on your furnace etc only about 1530 of the energy released by the burn goes into heating the exhaust flue and is thereby a component of the issue with entropy that the fart was originally about  if i let the impression that 100 does then its my mistake  however the energetics and thermodynamics of releasing that exhaust into the atmosphere is still such that i say confidently you would have to use _at least_ the energy equivalent to that of burning the original log to get the exhaust back nnend of your quote if you dont feel like reading all of this i would encourage you to just think about what i say at the very end of this comment regarding the way you seem to think you understand the thermodynamics of the situation better than published experts in this field whose views i have explicitly cited in my argument nnin the above you pretty clearly said that you thought that the amount of the energy gained was relevant in determining the thermodynamic feasibility it is not you now seem to be claiming that instead you were just hoping to estimate the amount of energy that would be required to capture the carbon but it is also not useful as an estimate of how much energy would be required even if it just so happens to be close if you assume all of the emissions were via natural gas but theres no reason to assume all emissions are from natural gas the blog post that you sent does not care at all about the source all that ive been trying to argue is that the energy gained from the co2 source does not matter it seems like maybe you now agree with this claim or perhaps you agreed with it all along nnto assess the thermodynamic feasibility of carbon capture you have to have to carry out a pretty involved modeling of the capture process any such model will make assumptions which other experts may or may not agree with which is why there are a range of estimates for the energy cost it is made especially difficult to estimate because we dont actually know what the efficiency of future technology will be so any estimate that relies on taking some thermodynamic limiting case and then estimating the energy expenditure of a real life material by guessing some efficiency as a percentage of the thermodynamic limiting case will be highly dependent on what someone guesses for the efficiency as i mentioned above the direct air capture article that i referred you to mentions how a typical efficiency range can be from 540 depending on how efficient researchers are able to make a material it could end up being energetically worthwhile there is no thermodynamically determined limit that guarantees carbon capture will use too much energy to make it worthwhile again i wonder why you are so insistent that i am wrong about this at this point ive summarized several journal articles about carbon capture and they agree with what im saying that carbon capture review article is what gave me the impression you were incorrect in the first place i read it a long time ago its one thing for you to say that me a random redditor whose background you know nothing about is wrong but why is it that youre so sure you understand carbon capture better than experts in the field that ive citednnedit nalso when you said this it confused menyour initial claim that thermodynamics limits dac to a point where it couldnt be feasible no matter how efficient it gotnnshow me where ive said that dac is impossible instead of unfeasible or  pretty please  shut up  intentional misrepresentation is not civilnnin the post where you quoted me i said you claim that  dac  couldnt be feasible no matter how efficient it got and then you tell me to shut up for saying that you said that dac is imposible instead of unfeasible im very confused by what caused your aggressive response as far as i can tell im this part where you quoted me im saying that you claimed dac was unfeasible if you think that when i said couldnt be feasible this was meant to be synonymous with impossible rather than unfeasible then either youve misread what i wrote or i wrote it poorly in either case i was not trying to intentionally misrepresent what you said i apologize if it came off like that and im also sort of surprised by your hostile tone herennto clarify what i meant by hopefully we can both agree on this point which is different from your initial claim that thermodynamics limits dac to a point where it couldnt be feasible no matter how efficient it got what i was trying to say is that my impression of what you have been saying is something like thermodynamics limits the energy efficiency of carbon capture in a way that no matter how efficient carbon capture technology got it would not be

Since this is a vector field, you'd need a 3d value at each point. You can convert the field equations to finite difference representations, and then look at how the results depend on the grid spacing.\n\nFEMM is based on the observation that a lot of the space will be oversampled (lots of points in a relatively uninteresting bit of field) in order to give enough points to the interesting bits. So instead we can collect regions of space together and call each one an element, and then put more smaller elements in the interesting bits of space, and fewer in the empty bits. This way the calculation effort is concentrated where it is needed. \n\nThe cost, though, is that FEMM is far more complex to understand, and involves choices about how you will set up your elements and whether you will dynamically add or change those elements as the calculation progresses (e.g. adapting to the shape of the field, or for time-dependent calculations).

0xd68,"First: There is a difference between ""natural occurring nuclides"" and ""primordial nuclides"". Natural occurring nuclides are all the nuclides that are found in nature, while primordial are the ones that still exists to today that where here when the earth was formed. The reason why uranium 238 is the heaviest natural occurring nucliede, is because all the other nuclides that have been discovered have half lives less than a million years, and since the earth is ~4,5 billion years they have all decayed. \nToday we know of about 3300 nuclides, most of them are unstable and only exist for less than a couple of minutes.\nIn the 1950s it was believed that some nuclides heavier than Z=92 should have half lives in the magnitude of billions of years. The reason why it was believed, is because the theory of ""the island of stability"" predicted that there should be ""magic numbers"" (the ratio between neutrons to protons) that makes the nucleus ""extremely"" stable.

0x1e68,"What I got from this it will technically work but the fillers might cause problem to health. Because I've tried b12 vape juuls and I felt an effect.\n\n>OP: As others have kindly, and correctly, suggested, you might want to abandon this line of inquiry. (I trained as a pharmacist and I actually understand this stuff.) When medications (including vitamins) are developed for different modes of drug delivery (oral [capsule/tablet/liquid], inhalation, parenteral, etc.) they are combined with other ingredients (excipients) that are intended for that mode of delivery only. Frequently, the active ingredient represents only a small portion of the delivery form. If someone tries to retroactively deliver a drug by a different mode (e.g., inhalation or injection), he/she is placing substances that were not intended for that organ into one's body. In the lungs, that can cause granulomas to develop and in the blood, clots that could reach vital organs. Also, the salt of the active agent might not be as soluble as needed, regardless of any misguided use of a nebulizer to make it so. Please do not consider putting anything in your body (or anybody else's) in a manner that it was not intended, there are enough problems in the world already, and you don't need to add to them.\n\n1. If the B vitamin liquid supplement is a sublingual how does your body break off the EXcipients/fillers that are attached to the molecule vitamins in just the mouth? Simply with saliva? So can you use it to break down and separate the fillers from the B vitamins?\n\n2. All vitamins are small molecules by default but because the supplement contains fillers which attached themselves to the vitamins because of the procedure cause it to become and big sized one collective. If they are collective it has to first be broken down into individual atoms, so the b vitamins have to be separated from the fillers otherwise if it gets directly into the body you won't be able to use it.\n\n3. So a Nebulizer breaks them down the atoms (vitamins and fillers in supplement) into small enough particle size your lungs can absorb, but the fillers are still attached to the vitamins, so can your lungs then separate them as it does with oxygen in air? Even pure B vitamin like just b12 and alcohol because alcohol is not produced by the body so once in the blood directly from injection together with b12 it will not do separate them as your body doesn't recognize alcohol which has changed the structure of the b12 which also changed the b12 into a big particle size. Therefore it has to go trough the gut system. But my idea here is WHAT IF the lungs (similarly to the gut) can also separate them into individual pieces as in detach the vitamins and recognize the essentialness of it therefore absorb it into the blood while exhaling the fillers? I guess your body absorbs everything including the fillers because it does when people smoke nicotine which isn't found in the body naturally. But the main thing here is that your lungs can separate the vitamins from the fillers once the nebulizer has made them into a small particle size? If the vitamin has other non natural supplement in there with the vitamin that your body doesnt have inside of itself naturally, then your body wont able to use and separate the vitamin from the filler whatever it is. When you add a filler depending on what it will most of the time attach clump together with the vitamin making it unusable and big. therefore, the oxygen is also clumped in with other stuff in the air, so before they go into the blood as you inhaled the air, your lungs separate them individually because things like nitrogen etc are not made by the body naturally. or exepection",Biology,what i got from this it will technically work but the fillers might cause problem to health because ive tried b12 vape juuls and i felt an effectnnop as others have kindly and correctly suggested you might want to abandon this line of inquiry i trained as a pharmacist and i actually understand this stuff when medications including vitamins are developed for different modes of drug delivery oral capsuletabletliquid inhalation parenteral etc they are combined with other ingredients excipients that are intended for that mode of delivery only frequently the active ingredient represents only a small portion of the delivery form if someone tries to retroactively deliver a drug by a different mode eg inhalation or injection heshe is placing substances that were not intended for that organ into ones body in the lungs that can cause granulomas to develop and in the blood clots that could reach vital organs also the salt of the active agent might not be as soluble as needed regardless of any misguided use of a nebulizer to make it so please do not consider putting anything in your body or anybody elses in a manner that it was not intended there are enough problems in the world already and you dont need to add to themnn1 if the b vitamin liquid supplement is a sublingual how does your body break off the excipientsfillers that are attached to the molecule vitamins in just the mouth simply with saliva so can you use it to break down and separate the fillers from the b vitaminsnn2 all vitamins are small molecules by default but because the supplement contains fillers which attached themselves to the vitamins because of the procedure cause it to become and big sized one collective if they are collective it has to first be broken down into individual atoms so the b vitamins have to be separated from the fillers otherwise if it gets directly into the body you wont be able to use itnn3 so a nebulizer breaks them down the atoms vitamins and fillers in supplement into small enough particle size your lungs can absorb but the fillers are still attached to the vitamins so can your lungs then separate them as it does with oxygen in air even pure b vitamin like just b12 and alcohol because alcohol is not produced by the body so once in the blood directly from injection together with b12 it will not do separate them as your body doesnt recognize alcohol which has changed the structure of the b12 which also changed the b12 into a big particle size therefore it has to go trough the gut system but my idea here is what if the lungs similarly to the gut can also separate them into individual pieces as in detach the vitamins and recognize the essentialness of it therefore absorb it into the blood while exhaling the fillers i guess your body absorbs everything including the fillers because it does when people smoke nicotine which isnt found in the body naturally but the main thing here is that your lungs can separate the vitamins from the fillers once the nebulizer has made them into a small particle size if the vitamin has other non natural supplement in there with the vitamin that your body doesnt have inside of itself naturally then your body wont able to use and separate the vitamin from the filler whatever it is when you add a filler depending on what it will most of the time attach clump together with the vitamin making it unusable and big therefore the oxygen is also clumped in with other stuff in the air so before they go into the blood as you inhaled the air your lungs separate them individually because things like nitrogen etc are not made by the body naturally or exepection,1,0,0

0xe51,"Well, the cell will either be transfected or lysed. \n\nTransfection: the virus injects its DNA into the cell, and has its DNA incorporated into the cell. From there, the viral genome will remain in the genome until the ""right time"", upon which it will be activated, begin producing viruses, and lyse the cell. This can be long-term and take however long it needs for the viral genes to be activated.\n\nLysing: The virus will override the replication machinery of the host cell, and redirect that machinery to replicating the viral genome instead of the host genome. Tons of viruses will be produced, so many that the cell will literally burst and release tons of other viruses.\n\nNow, there is another possible fate. It could be the case that the viral genome integrates itself into the genome of a cell, but just never gets the chance to ever begin replicating. It just kind of stays there. Then, it's possible that when the host cell replicates its own genome, a mutation will occur in the viral segment of the genome which will render the viral genome useless. If this happens, the mutated (and therefore dysfunctional) viral DNA will sort of just sit there in the host cell DNA forever and the cell will never lyse. There are actually huge portions of our own genome just made of up failed viruses which are now dysfunctional after our cellular replication machinery screwed up when it was trying to carefully replicate their genome.

Even the last universal common ancestor (LUCA) [has a full virome of its own](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-020-0408-x).

0x23f5,"I often see posts like this,\n\nThere is a lot of anxiety in people about ""chemicals"". Be it lead in tinned food, cyanide in almonds, passive smoke vapour from cigarettes. The lists of ""health hazards"" is practically limitless. But ""hazard"" is a sliding scale. You can technically die of a cyanide overdose from eating almonds (you'd have to eat astronomical amounts). There are cases of people overdosing on bananas (potassium has radioactive isotopes). What I'm getting at is there are things you should worry about, and things you shouldn't. And this is firmly in the ""don't need to worry about"" category.\n\nMuch bigger health concerns: smoking, drinking, obesity, diabetes, lack of exercise. \n\nNow this may be a totally innocent ""rabbit hole"" you've gone down. But this also very common in people who go on to develop more severe stress / anxiety about chemicals in the world around us. If you are feeling yourself becoming anxious when thinking about chemicals, please look into chemophobia and the call to nature fallacy.\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemophobia\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_nature\n\nThis wiki article is a good place to start. \n\nNow onto your specific issue with lead:\n\nYes, lead can bio accumulate. Yes, noone has found any health benefits to having lead in your diet. Have you ever met someone who's got lead poisoning from eating food and living a normal lifestyle? Almost certainly not. That's because governing bodies put regulations on how much lead contamination can be present in food. \n\nThat means someone, somewhere has worked out limits for exposures/doses to limit bio accumulation in humans. (In fact, many people work on this and other regulations). Even if there is not formal ""safe"" level, there is somewhere a ""practically safe"" level, where the concentration is low enough that we don't see health side effects in a normal populace. (Again, exact values may be unknown or disputed. Consider that lead has been around for 4000 ish years, and most cases of lead poisoning are either acute exposure, or from long term profession related exposure (eg, people working with lead paints)\n\nFor example, in the 1980s lead limits for tinned food were 4x higher (0.4 ppm Vs 0.1) than they are today, and even then, actual cases of chronic lead poisoning back then were low. Because they were sealing tin cans with lead solder. That no longer happens.\n\nI think my TLDR is: please ignore if this was an innocent ""rabbit hole"" question. If not, and you find yourself becoming anxious, I strongly advise you find online resources for chemistry, so you have a better understanding of things like concentration, doses, etc. There are tonnes of resources out there.\n\nThanks for taking time to read this!",Chemistry,i often see posts like thisnnthere is a lot of anxiety in people about chemicals be it lead in tinned food cyanide in almonds passive smoke vapour from cigarettes the lists of health hazards is practically limitless but hazard is a sliding scale you can technically die of a cyanide overdose from eating almonds youd have to eat astronomical amounts there are cases of people overdosing on bananas potassium has radioactive isotopes what im getting at is there are things you should worry about and things you shouldnt and this is firmly in the dont need to worry about categorynnmuch bigger health concerns smoking drinking obesity diabetes lack of exercise nnnow this may be a totally innocent rabbit hole youve gone down but this also very common in people who go on to develop more severe stress  anxiety about chemicals in the world around us if you are feeling yourself becoming anxious when thinking about chemicals please look into chemophobia and the call to nature fallacynnhttpsenmwikipediaorgwikichemophobiannhttpsenmwikipediaorgwikiappeal_to_naturennthis wiki article is a good place to start nnnow onto your specific issue with leadnnyes lead can bio accumulate yes noone has found any health benefits to having lead in your diet have you ever met someone whos got lead poisoning from eating food and living a normal lifestyle almost certainly not thats because governing bodies put regulations on how much lead contamination can be present in food nnthat means someone somewhere has worked out limits for exposuresdoses to limit bio accumulation in humans in fact many people work on this and other regulations even if there is not formal safe level there is somewhere a practically safe level where the concentration is low enough that we dont see health side effects in a normal populace again exact values may be unknown or disputed consider that lead has been around for 4000 ish years and most cases of lead poisoning are either acute exposure or from long term profession related exposure eg people working with lead paintsnnfor example in the 1980s lead limits for tinned food were 4x higher 04 ppm vs 01 than they are today and even then actual cases of chronic lead poisoning back then were low because they were sealing tin cans with lead solder that no longer happensnni think my tldr is please ignore if this was an innocent rabbit hole question if not and you find yourself becoming anxious i strongly advise you find online resources for chemistry so you have a better understanding of things like concentration doses etc there are tonnes of resources out therennthanks for taking time to read this,1,1,0

0x1745,"Hmm.  I would submit that many if not most highly-successful models in physics are or at least started out as exactly that:  hacks, as you've defined them here.  Models like old quantum theory, the Bohr model of the atom, and even the standard model of particle physics today — these models are (or started out as) a cobbling-together of disparate or otherwise questionable techniques (ex. perturbation theory, quantization, renormalization, etc.), some of which still don't have terribly satisfactory explanations today.  Yet, they were or still are ""unreasonably"" successful at ... well, modelling natural physics — or to put it another way, at making accurate predictions.\n\nIt seems to me that people — humans in general, and physicists/scientists by extension — are a bit too biased towards wanting elegance in models, or in the philosophy of science concerning those models.  While there are certainly some historical examples of ""deeper"" discovered theories or underlying mathematical framework being more elegant or simple or (for example as with gauge unification), there are arguably many more historical examples of deeper underlying theories/frameworks simply being more complicated and/or less elegant (ex. quantum mechanics compared to classical mechanics in general).\n\nTo borrow someone else's words (not sure who anymore), I think it's important not to confuse the quest for truth with a quest for beauty ... too often we want all of nature's loose ends to all be tied up neatly, but nature is under no obligation to be tame or elegant at all.  It's nice that we find it to be in some situations, but that doesn't mean we should expect nature to not have its own warts, too.

0x1961,"I would argue this phenomenon is the plate body behaving like a glider in the ground-effect region, and so extremely close to the ground, that viscous drag forces enter the system as well. \n\n(No particular order)\nEffect 1: as the plate approaches the floor at constant speed, the volume of air remaining below the plate diminishes linearly with the distance, so the exit-air’s volume flow rate should be constant over plate distance by this geometry. \n\nEffect 2: as the distance diminishes, the size of the escape windows for the air diminishes linearly. \n\nCombining 1 and 2, you have a constant volume flow rate getting restricted to a smaller and smaller conduit. The fluid speed tries to increase to maintain constant flow rate and constant plate speed, but this acceleration takes work. And the work done to accelerate the air is  coming from the plate’s downward kinetic energy. Therefore the plate slows down (at least in part) from this principle of needing to accelerate a fluid. \n\nEffect 3: when the plate gap gets quite small, there is now an exponentially increasing viscous drag impeding the air’s acceleration along the escape path. The air’s inability to get out fast enough causes a pressure rise, and the plate’s downward motion is decelerated even stronger now. Now it’s on a more pronounced “air cushion” but time is limited before it runs out. \n\nEffect 4: For very light and very large plate, there exists a critical gap size where the rising air pressure is almost able to counter the weight of the plate. It appears floating, initial downward speed is gone, but a small downward speed is still required for the air’s pressure to remain high. Now that the plate’s weight is almost balanced, the motion from here forward is now roughly constant. The plate approaches the floor at a constant speed in this regime, where the work of gravity on the plate equals the work required to force the viscous air through this tiny gap. \n\nEffect 5: now the plate may have had some forward momentum! Or otherwise, with the plate in the floating regime, air might realistically leave faster on one side, giving the plate a tilt. Now it “slides downhill” on this inclined air cushion. \n\nEffect 6: there now also exists some forward speed of the plate where the fresh air entering the leading edge of the gap is almost able to feed and sustain the air cushion indefinitely. The plate’s slow, constant descent onto the floor is now delayed even further by this \n\nIn all, the total combination of these effects can make falling, light, large plates stop descending, start sliding forward, and take a very unexpectedly long time to actually hit the floor and stop moving.",Physics,i would argue this phenomenon is the plate body behaving like a glider in the groundeffect region and so extremely close to the ground that viscous drag forces enter the system as well nnno particular orderneffect 1 as the plate approaches the floor at constant speed the volume of air remaining below the plate diminishes linearly with the distance so the exitairs volume flow rate should be constant over plate distance by this geometry nneffect 2 as the distance diminishes the size of the escape windows for the air diminishes linearly nncombining 1 and 2 you have a constant volume flow rate getting restricted to a smaller and smaller conduit the fluid speed tries to increase to maintain constant flow rate and constant plate speed but this acceleration takes work and the work done to accelerate the air is  coming from the plates downward kinetic energy therefore the plate slows down at least in part from this principle of needing to accelerate a fluid nneffect 3 when the plate gap gets quite small there is now an exponentially increasing viscous drag impeding the airs acceleration along the escape path the airs inability to get out fast enough causes a pressure rise and the plates downward motion is decelerated even stronger now now its on a more pronounced air cushion but time is limited before it runs out nneffect 4 for very light and very large plate there exists a critical gap size where the rising air pressure is almost able to counter the weight of the plate it appears floating initial downward speed is gone but a small downward speed is still required for the airs pressure to remain high now that the plates weight is almost balanced the motion from here forward is now roughly constant the plate approaches the floor at a constant speed in this regime where the work of gravity on the plate equals the work required to force the viscous air through this tiny gap nneffect 5 now the plate may have had some forward momentum or otherwise with the plate in the floating regime air might realistically leave faster on one side giving the plate a tilt now it slides downhill on this inclined air cushion nneffect 6 there now also exists some forward speed of the plate where the fresh air entering the leading edge of the gap is almost able to feed and sustain the air cushion indefinitely the plates slow constant descent onto the floor is now delayed even further by this nnin all the total combination of these effects can make falling light large plates stop descending start sliding forward and take a very unexpectedly long time to actually hit the floor and stop moving,1,2,0

0xfe6,"It's not a stupid question, just perhaps an uncomfortable one to consider.\n\nThe answer boils down to ""yes, but..."". Just as we have bred various animals for specific tasks, we could hypothetically breed ourselves for increased strength and durability, or for some other goal. If we can turn wild steppe horses into massive Clydesdales and speedy Arabians, or take grey wolves and turn them into mastiffs and chihuahuas, we can certainly do similar things to ourselves.\n\nThe thing is, though, such changes come with trade-offs. A growing body only has so many resources at its disposal, and sinking those resources into one organ or function takes them away from somewhere else. We humans dump a lot of resources into our huge brains, for example, at the cost of a lot of other things compared to other animals; it's just that our brains provide such a massive advantage that it's worth it.\n\nAnother thing to consider: I think it's in the final episode, but at some point Nolan tells Mark that Viltrumite genetics are so pure that Mark's basically fully-Viltrumite; Mark only inherited a few superficial genes from his human mother. That's not how things work; to a biologist, ""genetically pure"" actually means ""*super* inbred"". \n\nA lot of domestic animal breeds have health problems, especially pure-breds. Not only are pure-breds usually very inbred, but if they've been bred for specific purposes, they tend to be very good at that but worse at other things. If we started breeding humans specifically for strength and durability, or speed, or intelligence, or *whatever*, you're automatically limiting your potential gene-pool, and humans already have quite low genetic diversity compared to other species. Your super-strong humans are probably going to start developing other problems within a few generations, like heart defects or being more prone to cancer.

0x2367,"There's no sterile neutrino that's been discovered. When physicists talk about how we *know* the universe works, there's three active neutrinos and no steriles. There's always searches for new physics going on, and people look in the most likely places (whether that seems most likely because of theory, or because of data).\n\nThere are unexplained experimental signals from two experiments, LSND and MiniBooNE that could both be simultaneously explained by a sterile neutrino at around 1eV^2. This was far from enough for physicists to consider it a discovery, but it's a very, very good reason to do experiments to clarify.\n\nPhysicists don't consider the sterile neutrino to exist, it's considered a plausible hypothetical.\n\nBut the LSND-MiniBooNE data exist. It shows something not understood that needs to be. Part of the reason that LSND and MiniBooNE together is compelling is that they're almost  completely different in the way they work, they're completely different types of neutrino source, detector and interaction physics. It's weird that two experiments that were so different came out with results consistent with the same hypothetical particle (although they are not the only experiments in the world, and if you start combining everything in the world that could theoretically see that particle it gets less convincing).\n\nMicroBooNE was made to be a *lot* like MiniBooNE. It's using the same neutrino source, it's in almost exactly the same place (geographically, they're right next to each other, for physics purposes they're at almost the same distance from the source). MiniBooNE had a weakness - it was not good at telling the difference between electrons and photons. MicroBooNE was designed to be able to do that. So the analyses that were released look for the MiniBooNE event excess either as plausibly coming from electrons or from photons. The analyses that have been shown aren't explicitly stating ""does a sterile neutrino exist"", they're saying ""do we see the same excess as MiniBooNE"", somewhat agnostic to whatever the underlying reason for the excess is. If it's electrons, that's exciting and evidence that goes towards there being a sterile neutrino. If it's photons, that's less exciting and goes toward the idea a background at MiniBooNE was modelled inaccurately. What MicroBooNE actually saw was neither of those things - that the MiniBooNE signal didn't show up at all (at a pretty mediocre statistical signifiance, enough to say ""probably"" but not enough to rule anything out). But if that's true, there's got to be another reason. 3+1 (adding one sterile to the known three active neutrinos) is what experimental physicists talk about because it's the least you have to mess with the model to make it fit the data from these specific experiments. Theoretical physicists talk about a *lot* more things, because they're looking at *theories* that make sense, not just trying to make their data fit.\n\nSo, this is a negative result. It's not a particularly conclusive one, but it is an important one. It's interesting, it's told us a lot, but I probably wouldn't go so far as to say ""heralds new chapter in physics"". Something is going on with the LSND-MiniBooNE signal. MicroBooNE not seeing makes it weirder - which could be physics that is even more exotic (or, in the worst case could be that MiniBooNE and LSND somehow both screwed up in entirely different ways that were somehow very consistent). But there's a strong experimental program under construction to iron this out (or possibly just make the puzzle more confusing). You should look forward to more updates - and understand that there's not just a new fundamental particle every few years: physicists are looking for how the universe works, but they don't get to decide how the universe works, only where are the best places to look for something new. And this is still a great place to look, even given the negative results presented this week.",Physics,theres no sterile neutrino thats been discovered when physicists talk about how we know the universe works theres three active neutrinos and no steriles theres always searches for new physics going on and people look in the most likely places whether that seems most likely because of theory or because of datannthere are unexplained experimental signals from two experiments lsnd and miniboone that could both be simultaneously explained by a sterile neutrino at around 1ev2 this was far from enough for physicists to consider it a discovery but its a very very good reason to do experiments to clarifynnphysicists dont consider the sterile neutrino to exist its considered a plausible hypotheticalnnbut the lsndminiboone data exist it shows something not understood that needs to be part of the reason that lsnd and miniboone together is compelling is that theyre almost  completely different in the way they work theyre completely different types of neutrino source detector and interaction physics its weird that two experiments that were so different came out with results consistent with the same hypothetical particle although they are not the only experiments in the world and if you start combining everything in the world that could theoretically see that particle it gets less convincingnnmicroboone was made to be a lot like miniboone its using the same neutrino source its in almost exactly the same place geographically theyre right next to each other for physics purposes theyre at almost the same distance from the source miniboone had a weakness  it was not good at telling the difference between electrons and photons microboone was designed to be able to do that so the analyses that were released look for the miniboone event excess either as plausibly coming from electrons or from photons the analyses that have been shown arent explicitly stating does a sterile neutrino exist theyre saying do we see the same excess as miniboone somewhat agnostic to whatever the underlying reason for the excess is if its electrons thats exciting and evidence that goes towards there being a sterile neutrino if its photons thats less exciting and goes toward the idea a background at miniboone was modelled inaccurately what microboone actually saw was neither of those things  that the miniboone signal didnt show up at all at a pretty mediocre statistical signifiance enough to say probably but not enough to rule anything out but if thats true theres got to be another reason 31 adding one sterile to the known three active neutrinos is what experimental physicists talk about because its the least you have to mess with the model to make it fit the data from these specific experiments theoretical physicists talk about a lot more things because theyre looking at theories that make sense not just trying to make their data fitnnso this is a negative result its not a particularly conclusive one but it is an important one its interesting its told us a lot but i probably wouldnt go so far as to say heralds new chapter in physics something is going on with the lsndminiboone signal microboone not seeing makes it weirder  which could be physics that is even more exotic or in the worst case could be that miniboone and lsnd somehow both screwed up in entirely different ways that were somehow very consistent but theres a strong experimental program under construction to iron this out or possibly just make the puzzle more confusing you should look forward to more updates  and understand that theres not just a new fundamental particle every few years physicists are looking for how the universe works but they dont get to decide how the universe works only where are the best places to look for something new and this is still a great place to look even given the negative results presented this week,2,2,0

0x17f0,"IMO-->  Empathy is a multi-faceted problem.  I would relate it to the kind of computational power required to simulate our universe, with all of it's constantly changing and simultaneously interacting variables.  The more accurately you can create someone else's world in your mind, the deeper your empathetic understanding will be.  It would also require simulating any emotional feelings, separate from standard inputs like sight, sound, touch, taste, temperature, etc.  All environmental variables would need to be simultaneously processed, respective to their constant changes.  Empathy requires the kind of math quantum computers were built for.  Most of the same kinds of mental skills would be required when imagining a complex mechanical device in action, with all of it's moving parts, friction heat, outside influences, and any other variables.  For the same reasons it would also apply to complex chemical reactions or visualizing complex physics.

I have seen a number of fantastic professors that have interesting research that I would love to apply to be a PhD student in their labs, however I am unsure of the tenability, especially in terms of pre-earmarked budget, cost of living, expenses, resident requirements, resident requirements/fees, taxes, and even covid regulations. I am also unsure of what work culture is like in Europe. I have heard hear-say that Germany and Switzerland have student unions to push back on advisors and their requirements for PhD students to work 50-80 hours a week; that the work life balance for PhD candidates is actually a lot better than in the US. That sounds like a dream and another motivating factor that makes me interested.  \n  \nHas anyone made that leap? If so, would you care to comment?

It’s much less obvious what you should be doing and when you go wrong, it’s much less obvious why.  This gets way better as you become better, but the turn around time from asking the question to figuring out it’s not working to figuring out why it’s not working is far slower than in programming.\n\nIn programming, if you can design a solution in your head, there’s almost always a way to do it with enough work.  You also get fast feedback when your code doesn’t work, and even suggestions on where exactly that error is.  This is not true in chemistry research.\n\nHowever, in undergrad, it is if you understand chemistry.

0x1022,"This is a hard problem to answer precisely. It is sometimes called the protein folding problem. However, there are physical tendencies and regularities that can be used for understanding.\n\nFirst and probably easiest regularity is that the core of a protein (the part not exposed to the water solvent) is predominately hydrophobic. One way to think of it is that water don’t want those aliphatic chains messing with the nice hydrogen bonds, so amino acids like leucine, iso-leucine, methionine, phenylalanine are pushed away from contact with water. \n\nConversely many polar amino acids, like glutamate, lysine, end up at the exterior of the protein in contact with the water solvent.\n\nMinor note, there are membrane proteins that cross cell membranes. These membranes are hydrophobic in nature, and in those cases the regularities above are inverted. But I limit myself to discuss proteins that are mostly in contact with water inside and outside cells.\n\nHowever, the backbone of a protein contains polar groups. It can be attractive sometimes to bury a polar amino acid side-chain in the core too, and to bind with the buried polar groups. For reasons I will not get into here, buried hydrogen bonds can be very strong. If you find a protein with a buried hydrogen bond, you can expect that to be an important bond to stability or possibly function of said protein. Sometimes you can even have buried “salt bridges” where a negatively charged side-chain (like glutamate) is interacting with a positively charged side-chain (like lysine), and those will be quite strong.\n\nThere are a few special-case amino acids. Proline for example has an odd structure in that its side-chain binds to the backbone twice, not just to the alpha-carbon. Proline tends to “bend” the backbone differently from other amino acids. Therefore if you have one or several nearby prolines in the sequence, that very likely corresponds to a place where the protein forms a loop in terms of its tertiary structure.\n\nAnother special case is glycine, since it lacks a side-chain entirely. That leads to a more flexible backbone. \n\nAnother special case is histidine. This is an amino acid that has a pKa close to physiological pH. That means that by modest changes to the environment, this amino acid can flip between uncharged to charged. You can think of histidine as a way to functionally encode a pH switch. That means histidines tend to show up in places where some such functionality is needed. Great example is the FcRn binding of antibodies.\n\nAnother special case is cystine. This is the only amino acid that can form a covalent bond between side-chains. So called sulphur bridges can form between pairs of cystine side-chains. Covalent bonds are strong and add a great deal to protein stability. So again, if you see cystine amino acids in the sequence, they are often going to become part of sulphur bridges with other cystine amino acids in the sequence of with other chains in a quaternary structure.\n\nA key point in all this is that the tertiary structure is determined by interactions between pairs (or higher) of amino acids. You can therefore never fully say what one particular amino acid side-chain will end up in the tertiary structure. You can say some things to be more or less likely based on the regularities above. However, to say anything with more certainty requires more careful analysis. \n\nLet me take one special observed regularity. The so called [leucine zipper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leucine_zipper) is a motif wherein leucine appears at every seventh sequence position for some stretch. This can be explained as it leads to very favourable dimerization of two helices such that the leucine side-chains “zip up” very well together (recall they are highly hydrophobic). So if you happen to see a handful of leucine amino acids spaced seven positions apart in the sequence, you might guess that’s going to be part of a tertiary (or quaternary) structure of a leucine zipper.\n\nThere are other such regularities. However, they are rarely perfect and rarely sufficient to figure out tertiary structures from sequence alone. For that you need to consider more relations that are more complex that these types of rules-of-thumb I’ve outlined above. \n\nIt is also noteworthy that for most proteins, their tertiary structure is stable under single mutations (say you replace one amino acid with another). So again one single amino acid side-chain change often (not always) does not change the higher-order structure. Some tertiary structures are extremely stable under most mutations. The [immunoglobulin domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_domain) is a good example of a higher-order protein structure that appears in many quite distinct proteins, and nowadays one can predict if a sequence will form such a structure pretty well because of certain highly conserved features in the sequence.\n\nAnyways, this can go on for long, and structural biology is the place to study this in more detail. Your teacher’s hesitancy to provide details is understandable since it is not an easy problem with a big body of research literature and without simple or certain rules if you go beyond the most basic regularities.",Biology,this is a hard problem to answer precisely it is sometimes called the protein folding problem however there are physical tendencies and regularities that can be used for

Aerobic organisms derive most of their energy from respiration, which on a cellular level involves the use of O2 and glucose to generate ATP (a ""currency"" of life). CO2 is created as a waste product and must be removed from cells. This occurs by the CO2 diffusing into the blood where (as others have noted) it forms carbonic acid. The blood carries this to the lungs where it's released and diffused across the alveolar membrane in the alveoli and is exhaled. Based on this, if CO2: (1) Was not generated during respiration, very little ATP would be created and the organism would die; (2) CO2 was not carried into the blood, same result; (3) If CO2 levels rise in the blood, pH would change and enzymes would not function correct, resulting in death; (4) Similar scenarios would occur if the CO2 was not taken to the lungs and exhaled.

Master’s level chemists are often looked at as “failed pHDs” unless they also have a lot of experience. The problem is that academic/theoretical chemistry experience at the B.S. level doesn’t give enough actual lab experience.

So it's a mix of triglycerides and burnt carbon deposits, not what you may think of as ""oil"".\n\nThe acetic acid in vinegar is in the neutral or non-ionic form.

The vinegar penetrating and lifting can allow you to mechanically scrape up chunks instead of dealing with a corrosive mess of liquid, similar to a paint stripper.\n\nDropping the pH will protonate any fatty acids and triglyerides from their ionic form into a neutral non-ionic form.

And since all leptons and quarks have a weak interaction (or a component with a weak interaction) it has very weird consequences with how particles gain mass.\n\nIn principle a particle could have multiple effects that give mass and they'd just add up to the physical mass that we observe. And there is one super simple way to add a mass term to the Lagrangian (the Lagrangian allows you to then calculate how stuff moves and interacts and stuff). You just write m \* psibar \* psi where psi and psibar are the fermion and its antiparticle in question and m is some free parameter that is the particle's mass. But because all those fermions interact with a field that picks out the left handed side, such a term is forbidden. Peter Higgs, and others, realized the solution to this: let every fermion couple to a new field and then let this field be non-zero everywhere. This gives something that is equivalent to the above mass term in every way, but also respects the left handedness of particles. This is known as electroweak symmetry breaking and over the last decade has been confirmed to be how reality works.\n\nWith neutrinos its even weirder, but I'm getting pretty far off point.",Physics,as someone else mentioned yeah its the weak interaction thats weird in this way not neutrinos and since all leptons and quarks have a weak interaction or a component with a weak interaction it has very weird consequences with how particles gain massnnin principle a particle could have multiple effects that give mass and theyd just add up to the physical mass that we observe and there is one super simple way to add a mass term to the lagrangian the lagrangian allows you to then calculate how stuff moves and interacts and stuff you just write m  psibar  psi where psi and psibar are the fermion and its antiparticle in question and m is some free parameter that is the particles mass but because all those fermions interact with a field that picks out the left handed side such a term is forbidden peter higgs and others realized the solution to this let every fermion couple to a new field and then let this field be nonzero everywhere this gives something that is equivalent to the above mass term in every way but also respects the left handedness of particles this is known as electroweak symmetry breaking and over the last decade has been confirmed to be how reality worksnnwith neutrinos its even weirder but im getting pretty far off point,1,2,0

I have very light blue eyes and I'm miserable in the sun, but I can have a kid just fine and pass on that trait. If blue eyed people were so inhibited by their blue eyes, we'd die out before we were able to reproduce, but it's just one of those things that has a negligible impact on reproduction.\n\nSo, why do soybeans have more proteins?

""How"" did soybeans start making more amino acids and how did that not impact their survival (i.e., how did their proteins not all clump up and kill them) is biochemistry stuff.\n\nFor the philosophers, I'll leave the wise words of my friend Joe Dirt: ""[""Why's a tree good?

0x248c,"Any virus will be under selection for higher transmissibility / infectivity. Not because of any ""want"", natural selection doesn't require desires. Most viruses have relatively high mutation rates, and while the vast majority of these mutations will be harmful to viral replication, some may improve transmission. Thanks to high replication rates in hosts (ofther factors being equal), any variants with higher transmissibility will quickly come to dominate the viral population.\n\nUntil recent decades, it was believed that viruses were under selection for *less* virulence (which FYI, means ""disease severity or lethality""), because a virus that rapidly kills or incapacitates its hosts will encounter fewer hosts to infect. For example the 1918 H1N1 influenza was remarkable for being rapidly lethal in susceptible hosts, with some infected with severe disease going from asymptomatic to dead in under a day. This actually hindered its spread, as the infected had only a very brief window of time to spread the disease. It perhaps should come as no surprise that modern relatives of H1N1 are far less virulent.\n\nHowever, there are some important exceptions. If a virus is normally transmitted in a pre-symptomatic stage of infection, there will be little selection for less virulence. For transmission, it wont matter much if all infected drop dead if there are many days in which hosts are infections and in contact with others.\n\nAnd if a virus relies on the same mechanism for both transmissibility and virulence, then the positive selection for transmissibility can entail some selection for higher virulence. For example, the binding affinity of the SARS CoV-2 spike protein for host ACE receptors has effects both on lowering the effective infectious dose / inoculum (thus increasing  transmissibility), as well as increasing the rate of viral replication within hosts, plausibly leading to viral replication outpacing host immune response. The Delta variant has nearly doubled transmissibility compared to wild type, and somewhat higher virulence in some host age groups. Here, its possible that the expected selection for higher transmissibility is also bringing some selection for higher virulence.",Biology,any virus will be under selection for higher transmissibility  infectivity not because of any want natural selection doesnt require desires most viruses have relatively high mutation rates and while the vast majority of these mutations will be harmful to viral replication some may improve transmission thanks to high replication rates in hosts ofther factors being equal any variants with higher transmissibility will quickly come to dominate the viral populationnnuntil recent decades it was believed that viruses were under selection for less virulence which fyi means disease severity or lethality because a virus that rapidly kills or incapacitates its hosts will encounter fewer hosts to infect for example the 1918 h1n1 influenza was remarkable for being rapidly lethal in susceptible hosts with some infected with severe disease going from asymptomatic to dead in under a day this actually hindered its spread as the infected had only a very brief window of time to spread the disease it perhaps should come as no surprise that modern relatives of h1n1 are far less virulentnnhowever there are some important exceptions if a virus is normally transmitted in a presymptomatic stage of infection there will be little selection for less virulence for transmission it wont matter much if all infected drop dead if there are many days in which hosts are infections and in contact with othersnnand if a virus relies on the same mechanism for both transmissibility and virulence then the positive selection for transmissibility can entail some selection for higher virulence for example the binding affinity of the sars cov2 spike protein for host ace receptors has effects both on lowering the effective infectious dose  inoculum thus increasing  transmissibility as well as increasing the rate of viral replication within hosts plausibly leading to viral replication outpacing host immune response the delta variant has nearly doubled transmissibility compared to wild type and somewhat higher virulence in some host age groups here its possible that the expected selection for higher transmissibility is also bringing some selection for higher virulence,0,0,2

0x1118,"I think the word you're looking for is altruism, and act of compassion towards another unrelated organism with little to no regard for the risk to oneself or compensation of such an act. In humans it is evident, although there is an ongoing debate on whether an act can be truly altruistic given that, on a subconscious level, it is almost exclusively beneficial to be compassionate towards others, that is in most circumstances being kind to others earns us positive endorphins, a feeling of satisfaction when you help someone you don't know, which is the pinnacle of evolution in social animals. We are hard wired to sacrifice for others due to the parent-offspring bond which is so strong it extends to other potentially unrelated people and even other species. The same can be said for cetaceans, which are not far behind us in terms of social evolution. Although they may not be aware, or even capable of being aware of a potential payoff for helping a distressed swimmer at their own risk (although they likely do have these cognitive capabilites, at least where it concerns helping unrelated members of their own species), their social cognition is also hard wired to aid conspecifics and other creatures (humans, seals, other whales) based on their cognitively advanced awareness of present danger and the panicked behaviour of the organism in distress. Again, the payoff is positive endorphins rather than, let's say, the abstract idea of ""I'll scratch your back if you scratch mine"". I'm not sure this meta study has been done, but I would hypothesise that the greater sociality of a species, the greater frequency of acts deemed to be altruistic will be seen in that species, which simply means the more social an animal is, the more it will behave in a selfless manner towards non-related organisms. But again, there is a reward whether you're aware of it or not, that being positive endorphins. One is certainly aware of the positive effect these endorphins have on the body and mind, and being aware of this benefit thus calls into question the ""selfless"" nature of putting yourself at risk for others.

0x2808,">I think it was Bohr who said ""the universe is inherently unknowable"". It's hard to say what pressures we place on the space of ideas we have about the world without being able to examine things from a nonhuman perspective. I think people find solace in attributing order and meaning to the patterns we observe and our place inside them. That might be limiting us from a more integrated view of nature - the word ""uni verse"" already attributes a singular harmony to reality, but it's entirely possible it's all a discordant chaotic mess in the end. I'm not sure where that leaves us considering we do still make an ""unreasonable"" level of progress as you say. \n\nI don't disagree on any particular point. :)\n\n>It's also possible the laws of the universe - which I would argue ultimately stem from the least action principle, that is itself formulated in terms of the behavior of a presupposed system - are self-organizing and emergent, in that they are imposed through consensus rather than absolution. In that sense maybe there is no underlying structure or meaning beyond what is attributed, and that alone makes it real. Who knows :)\n\nMmmm, it seems unlikely to me that all underlying structure is emergent — after all we seem to have no problem identifying phenomena that appear to be fundamental so far.  Surely some (arguably most; yes condensed matter I'm looking at you! :) dynamics are emergent though.\n\nIn any case, even if there is an underlying system I guess what I'm trying to articulate is that the principles of that underlying system don't need to be elegant, or even integrated into a single cohesive model.  It may be the case that the underlying principles are really just multiple unrelated ""models""/systems/frameworks all cobbled together in what intuitively seems like a ""hacky"" or ad-hoc way from our human perspective.\n\nPlaying ""god"" for a minute, one could perhaps look at all the final underlying principles of physics and characterize them as ""well we slapped this idea together with these two, and then glued it all together using *this* one, and by golly would you look at that: it can sustain intelligent life! who'da thunk it?""\n\nAs much as I *abhor* the anthropic principle and consider it a non-explanation for any phenomenon in general, I'll admit it is still entirely possible (perhaps even probable if some flavor of cosmic inflation is true) that those underlying principles just happen to be random and we were lucky enough to win the anthropic lottery. :p\n\nAnyhow, cheers and thanks for the interesting convo! :)",Physics,i think it was bohr who said the universe is inherently unknowable its hard to say what pressures we place on the space of ideas we have about the world without being able to examine things from a nonhuman perspective i think people find solace in attributing order and meaning to the patterns we observe and our place inside them that might be limiting us from a more integrated view of nature  the word uni verse already attributes a singular harmony to reality but its entirely possible its all a discordant chaotic mess in the end im not sure where that leaves us considering we do still make an unreasonable level of progress as you say nni dont disagree on any particular point nnits also possible the laws of the universe  which i would argue ultimately stem from the least action principle that is itself formulated in terms of the behavior of a presupposed system  are selforganizing and emergent in that they are imposed through consensus rather than absolution in that sense maybe there is no underlying structure or meaning beyond what is attributed and that alone makes it real who knows nnmmmm it seems unlikely to me that all underlying structure is emergent  after all we seem to have no problem identifying phenomena that appear to be fundamental so far  surely some arguably most yes condensed matter im looking at you  dynamics are emergent thoughnnin any case even if there is an underlying system i guess what im trying to articulate is that the principles of that underlying system dont need to be elegant or even integrated into a single cohesive model  it may be the case that the underlying principles are really just multiple unrelated modelssystemsframeworks all cobbled together in what intuitively seems like a hacky or adhoc way from our human perspectivennplaying god for a minute one could perhaps look at all the final underlying principles of physics and characterize them as well we slapped this idea together with these two and then glued it all together using this one and by golly would you look at that it can sustain intelligent life whoda thunk itnnas much as i abhor the anthropic principle and consider it a nonexplanation for any phenomenon in general ill admit it is still entirely possible perhaps even probable if some flavor of cosmic inflation is true that those underlying principles just happen to be random and we were lucky enough to win the anthropic lottery pnnanyhow cheers and thanks for the interesting convo ,0,2,2

It's easiest to understand ""the concentration of water in water"" using mass % or volume %. Two solutions of distilled water are each 100% water, so the concentration in each is just... 100%, by mass or volume. It might be a little counterintuitive because you're used to considering the concentration of something else, like salt or sugar, in water. But if two solutions are both pure water, then their concentration of water is the same.\n\nAs for your second point, I really hate the way people explain diffusion in school, and it tripped me up for a while too. The better way to understand diffusion is like this: there's no force pulling molecules towards an area of low concentration. Each molecule is moving completely randomly, bouncing off of things and getting thrown around by its neighbors. It doesn't know what a ""concentration"" is, and it doesn't care. But if you have a setup with a semipermeable membrane like this:\n\n    A            |           B\n     x  x x  x   |            \n      x x x x x  |        x   \n    x  xx  xx x  |\n\nWhich is more likely: that any one of the 15 Xs crammed into side A will hit the membrane and cross into side B, or that the one lonely little X on side B will find its way to side A? Clearly, there are more Xs on side A, so there are 15 times more opportunities for a particle to cross into side B. And we say that the solution diffuses into side B, though each molecule in it is moving completely randomly.\n\nWhen you have the same number of objects on one side as the other, they're still moving around just as fast, but now there's an equal likelihood of a molecule randomly moving in either direction.

0xe24,"You make some good points, but I think it’s important to recognize that carbon capture companies that sequester their carbon rather than using it for energy would be making money primarily via government funding. \n\nYes, they could in principle come to rely on there being more CO2 emitted so that it was worth it for the plant to be functioning, but this would only be an issue if the government was unable to pass laws that required a switch to clean energy. You could argue that CO2 capture technology and companies are bad because they might enable fossil fuel use rather than switching over to renewables, so that the government wouldn’t pass legislation that reduced fossil fuel consumption. On a practical level, this type of argument is a reasonable concern, and I think that it’s important to keep in the public discourse around carbon capture. At the same time, direct air capture had the potential to be so valuable in terms of removing historic CO2 emissions that I don’t think we should just ignore it because of its potential to be misused. Another nice side effect of CO2 capture technology is that many of the materials useful for carbon capture are similar to materials used to capture pollutants or toxic elements both from gas streams and water, and these types of small molecule adsorbents might prove to be very good for human and environmental health.",Physics,you make some good points but i think its important to recognize that carbon capture companies that sequester their carbon rather than using it for energy would be making money primarily via government funding nnyes they could in principle come to rely on there being more co2 emitted so that it was worth it for the plant to be functioning but this would only be an issue if the government was unable to pass laws that required a switch to clean energy you could argue that co2 capture technology and companies are bad because they might enable fossil fuel use rather than switching over to renewables so that the government wouldnt pass legislation that reduced fossil fuel consumption on a practical level this type of argument is a reasonable concern and i think that its important to keep in the public discourse around carbon capture at the same time direct air capture had the potential to be so valuable in terms of removing historic co2 emissions that i dont think we should just ignore it because of its potential to be misused another nice side effect of co2 capture technology is that many of the materials useful for carbon capture are similar to materials used to capture pollutants or toxic elements both from gas streams and water and these types of small molecule adsorbents might prove to be very good for human and environmental health,1,2,0

0x18c1,"Well, the cell will either be transfected or lysed. \n\nTransfection: the virus injects its DNA into the cell, and has its DNA incorporated into the cell. From there, the viral genome will remain in the genome until the ""right time"", upon which it will be activated, begin producing viruses, and lyse the cell. This can be long-term and take however long it needs for the viral genes to be activated.\n\nLysing: The virus will override the replication machinery of the host cell, and redirect that machinery to replicating the viral genome instead of the host genome. Tons of viruses will be produced, so many that the cell will literally burst and release tons of other viruses.\n\nNow, there is another possible fate. It could be the case that the viral genome integrates itself into the genome of a cell, but just never gets the chance to ever begin replicating. It just kind of stays there. Then, it's possible that when the host cell replicates its own genome, a mutation will occur in the viral segment of the genome which will render the viral genome useless. If this happens, the mutated (and therefore dysfunctional) viral DNA will sort of just sit there in the host cell DNA forever and the cell will never lyse. There are actually huge portions of our own genome just made of up failed viruses which are now dysfunctional after our cellular replication machinery screwed up when it was trying to carefully replicate their genome. This is not only true for our genome, but true for the genome of virtually every known organism. Even the last universal common ancestor (LUCA) [has a full virome of its own](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-020-0408-x). Some researchers actually once produced a corrective mutation in one of the dysfunctional viruses in our genomes, and it started producing viruses again. If I'm not mistaken, there are actually practical relevances to these failed viruses, such as in organ transplant. Organ transplant from other organisms for humans is best with pigs, but researchers are actually working to purge some pig genomes of these failed viruses because they result in compatibility issues when trying to transplant them into our own bodies.",Biology,well the cell will either be transfected or lysed nntransfection the virus injects its dna into the cell and has its dna incorporated into the cell from there the viral genome will remain in the genome until the right time upon which it will be activated begin producing viruses and lyse the cell this can be longterm and take however long it needs for the viral genes to be activatednnlysing the virus will override the replication machinery of the host cell and redirect that machinery to replicating the viral genome instead of the host genome tons of viruses will be produced so many that the cell will literally burst and release tons of other virusesnnnow there is another possible fate it could be the case that the viral genome integrates itself into the genome of a cell but just never gets the chance to ever begin replicating it just kind of stays there then its possible that when the host cell replicates its own genome a mutation will occur in the viral segment of the genome which will render the viral genome useless if this happens the mutated and therefore dysfunctional viral dna will sort of just sit there in the host cell dna forever and the cell will never lyse there are actually huge portions of our own genome just made of up failed viruses which are now dysfunctional after our cellular replication machinery screwed up when it was trying to carefully replicate their genome this is not only true for our genome but true for the genome of virtually every known organism even the last universal common ancestor luca has a full virome of its ownhttpswwwnaturecomarticless415790200408x some researchers actually once produced a corrective mutation in one of the dysfunctional viruses in our genomes and it started producing viruses again if im not mistaken there are actually practical relevances to these failed viruses such as in organ transplant organ transplant from other organisms for humans is best with pigs but researchers are actually working to purge some pig genomes of these failed viruses because they result in compatibility issues when trying to transplant them into our own bodies,2,0,0

Aerobic organisms derive most of their energy from respiration, which on a cellular level involves the use of O2 and glucose to generate ATP (a ""currency"" of life). CO2 is created as a waste product and must be removed from cells. This occurs by the CO2 diffusing into the blood where (as others have noted) it forms carbonic acid. The blood carries this to the lungs where it's released and diffused across the alveolar membrane in the alveoli and is exhaled. Based on this, if CO2: (1) Was not generated during respiration, very little ATP would be created and the organism would die; (2) CO2 was not carried into the blood, same result; (3) If CO2 levels rise in the blood, pH would change and enzymes would not function correct, resulting in death; (4) Similar scenarios would occur if the CO2 was not taken to the lungs and exhaled.

It's easiest to understand ""the concentration of water in water"" using mass % or volume %. Two solutions of distilled water are each 100% water, so the concentration in each is just... 100%, by mass or volume. It might be a little counterintuitive because you're used to considering the concentration of something else, like salt or sugar, in water. But if two solutions are both pure water, then their concentration of water is the same.\n\nAs for your second point, I really hate the way people explain diffusion in school, and it tripped me up for a while too. The better way to understand diffusion is like this: there's no force pulling molecules towards an area of low concentration. Each molecule is moving completely randomly, bouncing off of things and getting thrown around by its neighbors. It doesn't know what a ""concentration"" is, and it doesn't care. But if you have a setup with a semipermeable membrane like this:\n\n    A            |           B\n     x  x x  x   |            \n      x x x x x  |        x   \n    x  xx  xx x  |\n\nWhich is more likely: that any one of the 15 Xs crammed into side A will hit the membrane and cross into side B, or that the one lonely little X on side B will find its way to side A? Clearly, there are more Xs on side A, so there are 15 times more opportunities for a particle to cross into side B. And we say that the solution diffuses into side B, though each molecule in it is moving completely randomly.\n\nWhen you have the same number of objects on one side as the other, they're still moving around just as fast, but now there's an equal likelihood of a molecule randomly moving in either direction. So we say our net diffusion is zero, even though the molecules are crossing the boundary at the same rate.",Biology,regarding your question about concentrationnnread the different ways to calculate concentration here httpswwwthoughtcocomdefinitionofconcentration605844httpswwwthoughtcocomdefinitionofconcentration605844 its easiest to understand the concentration of water in water using mass  or volume  two solutions of distilled water are each 100 water so the concentration in each is just 100 by mass or volume it might be a little counterintuitive because youre used to considering the concentration of something else like salt or sugar in water but if two solutions are both pure water then their concentration of water is the samennas for your second point i really hate the way people explain diffusion in school and it tripped me up for a while too the better way to understand diffusion is like this theres no force pulling molecules towards an area of low concentration each molecule is moving completely randomly bouncing off of things and getting thrown around by its neighbors it doesnt know what a concentration is and it doesnt care but if you have a setup with a semipermeable membrane like thisnn    a                       bn     x  x x  x               n      x x x x x          x   n    x  xx  xx x  nnwhich is more likely that any one of the 15 xs crammed into side a will hit the membrane and cross into side b or that the one lonely little x on side b will find its way to side a clearly there are more xs on side a so there are 15 times more opportunities for a particle to cross into side b and we say that the solution diffuses into side b though each molecule in it is moving completely randomlynnwhen you have the same number of objects on one side as the other theyre still moving around just as fast but now theres an equal likelihood of a molecule randomly moving in either direction so we say our net diffusion is zero even though the molecules are crossing the boundary at the same rate,0,0,2

Just a bunch of chemicals, and nothing really exotic.\n\nWe had piperidine, and tetrahydropyrimidine, both smelled somewhere on the bad side of the spectrum. Can't speak much about thiophenol - it was contained safely in a well-corked vial with several layers of polyetylene zip-bags, inside a glass bottle, and all in the fridge at +3 celsius. Whoever had packed it so well was clearly not intended to open it anytime soon.\n\nOxygen compounds have rather pleasant smell - methyl-tert-butyl ether, methyl-isobutyl ketone, 2-hexanone (methyl-butyl ketone). Furfural and furane and tetrahydrofurane (however the last one is borderline pleasant). Monoethanolamine is another one which is at the same time good and bad.\n\nDimethylsulphide is probably bad but we had it very diluted (somewhat 0.1% mass in propane). Dibuthylsulphide, on another hand, we had as a pure substance - and it is not pleasant at all, just believe me.\n\nBut the worst one was not the pure substance but the industrial byproduct (or, rather, residue). A greedy client hired us to determine what good - if any - contain his residues. It were residuals from olefine production, and from that fact you may tell they smelled horribly. He basically had a dozen of railroad tanks of that shit. Lighter products contained mostly butadienes (from which the 1,2-butadiene was the major one, defying thermodynamics), and the rest was a cocktail from hell - butyne-1, butyne-2, vinylacetylene and products of their polymerization. (I learned from literature that vinylacetylene is not only prone to polymerization - but it performs it so eagerly that it often proceeds with explosion. Thankfully, we did not learned that from first-hand experience!). \n\nHeavier fraction was not any better. We analyzed it with the method ASTM D 6730 (with huge red remark that this metod was not developed to determination of composition of so miserable, bad-looking, skunk-smelling devil mixtures). Oh dear. The majority, turns out, was styrene - upto 30%, and it by itself is not the best thing to work - not only it smells horribly, it also may be referred as a liquified cancer.  The rest were various compounds of various degrees of unsaturation, partially polymerized, partially oxidated, and believe me, the entire chromatogram was something to see - and to stick labels to various peaks. The test method had the relative retention times for approx 500 compounds - we found them all (discovered by the way there are some incorrect peaks in the reference table), but we also had several dozens which we can't stick a label to. I still believe there were some compounds still unknown to humanity.",Chemistry,my lab was not the most smelly lab in the world we did not make any iffy fine organic synthesis just a bunch of chemicals and nothing really exoticnnwe had piperidine and tetrahydropyrimidine both smelled somewhere on the bad side of the spectrum cant speak much about thiophenol  it was contained safely in a wellcorked vial with several layers of polyetylene zipbags inside a glass bottle and all in the fridge at 3 celsius whoever had packed it so well was clearly not intended to open it anytime soonnnoxygen compounds have rather pleasant smell  methyltertbutyl ether methylisobutyl ketone 2hexanone methylbutyl ketone furfural and furane and tetrahydrofurane however the last one is borderline pleasant monoethanolamine is another one which is at the same time good and badnndimethylsulphide is probably bad but we had it very diluted somewhat 01 mass in propane dibuthylsulphide on another hand we had as a pure substance  and it is not pleasant at all just believe mennbut the worst one was not the pure substance but the industrial byproduct or rather residue a greedy client hired us to determine what good  if any  contain his residues it were residuals from olefine production and from that fact you may tell they smelled horribly he basically had a dozen of railroad tanks of that shit lighter products contained mostly butadienes from which the 12butadiene was the major one defying thermodynamics and the rest was a cocktail from hell  butyne1 butyne2 vinylacetylene and products of their polymerization i learned from literature that vinylacetylene is not only prone to polymerization  but it performs it so eagerly that it often proceeds with explosion thankfully we did not learned that from firsthand experience nnheavier fraction was not any better we analyzed it with the method astm d 6730 with huge red remark that this metod was not developed to determination of composition of so miserable badlooking skunksmelling devil mixtures oh dear the majority turns out was styrene  upto 30 and it by itself is not the best thing to work  not only it smells horribly it also may be referred as a liquified cancer  the rest were various compounds of various degrees of unsaturation partially polymerized partially oxidated and believe me the entire chromatogram was something to see  and to stick labels to various peaks the test method had the relative retention times for approx 500 compounds  we found them all discovered by the way there are some incorrect peaks in the reference table but we also had several dozens which we cant stick a label to i still believe there were some compounds still unknown to humanity,1,1,0

Now, the further Electromagnetic waves travel, the higher the redshift is measured with an ""infinite redshift"" at the event horizon of our observable universe. \n\nDoes that mean the wavelength of those photons approach 0 and wouldn't that also mean, that energy density decreases with time and distance , leading to the curvature of spacetime to ""flatten"", but since energy is always conserved, wouldn't that also mean that space seemingly increases?

0x1dfb,"As others have mentioned, the physical differences in scale often directly lead to differences in chemical properties. In general, as your volume goes up, the surface area/volume ratio of your container decreases, so there will be changes in any area-dependent processes (like heat exchange). Some processes that are fairly straightforward on the bench like filtration or evaporation can become much bigger headaches when scaled up. Something as simple as mixing might take hours instead of minutes- and if you have always mixed a solution for 10 minutes on the benchtop, you might get the nasty surprise that it isn't stable if you mix it for 3 hours.\n\nScale-up often also affects your equipment and the materials involved. You might mix something on the bench in a glass flask with a PTFE stirbar on a hotplate. In the plant, it might be done in a hot water jacketed stainless steel tank with an overhead blade mixer. All of the changes you make to scale up- more powerful mixers, bigger pumps, larger diameter pipes and hoses, can introduce unexpected effects into your system beyond just bigger scale. A big challenge with scaling up pharmaceuticals for instance is that any new material you introduce into the method that has the opportunity for product contact, particularly soft materials like hoses and gaskets, has the potential to leach into your product, or catalyze degradation, or otherwise do something bad that you never saw in the lab.",Chemistry,as others have mentioned the physical differences in scale often directly lead to differences in chemical properties in general as your volume goes up the surface areavolume ratio of your container decreases so there will be changes in any areadependent processes like heat exchange some processes that are fairly straightforward on the bench like filtration or evaporation can become much bigger headaches when scaled up something as simple as mixing might take hours instead of minutes and if you have always mixed a solution for 10 minutes on the benchtop you might get the nasty surprise that it isnt stable if you mix it for 3 hoursnnscaleup often also affects your equipment and the materials involved you might mix something on the bench in a glass flask with a ptfe stirbar on a hotplate in the plant it might be done in a hot water jacketed stainless steel tank with an overhead blade mixer all of the changes you make to scale up more powerful mixers bigger pumps larger diameter pipes and hoses can introduce unexpected effects into your system beyond just bigger scale a big challenge with scaling up pharmaceuticals for instance is that any new material you introduce into the method that has the opportunity for product contact particularly soft materials like hoses and gaskets has the potential to leach into your product or catalyze degradation or otherwise do something bad that you never saw in the lab,1,1,0

0x134e,"I have a question about hypothetical spacecraft trajectories between destinations in the solar system. I know that the most fuel efficient trajectory (ignoring gravity assists) between, say, Earth and Mars is a Hohmann transfer orbit. This involves accelerating along the starting orbit to raise the aphelion, which is timed to line up with the target in both space and time. Given our current propulsion technology, a Hohmann transfer or some similar variation is the only feasible trajectory.\n\nWith magic sci-fi engines that can output a high level of constant thrust indefinitely (like 1+ g's), such as the Epstein drive in *the Expanse*, the trajectory becomes a ""flip and burn"" scenario where the spacecraft accelerates toward the target for half the journey, then flips around to decelerate for the second half. Journeys take days rather than months, and the trajectory is nearly a straight line.\n\nThat was a rather long-winded introduction, but my question is the following - imagine a ship has an onboard fusion reactor which powers some form of highly efficient electric propulsion. This lets the ship accelerate essentially indefinitely, but only at a fraction of a g (let's say less than 1 m/s\^2 or even less). **What shape does the optimal trajectory become?** Gravity is no longer ""negligible"" as in the flip and burn scenario, but the journey would still be far faster than a traditional transfer orbit with just a single burn at the start and end.",Physics,i have a question about hypothetical spacecraft trajectories between destinations in the solar system i know that the most fuel efficient trajectory ignoring gravity assists between say earth and mars is a hohmann transfer orbit this involves accelerating along the starting orbit to raise the aphelion which is timed to line up with the target in both space and time given our current propulsion technology a hohmann transfer or some similar variation is the only feasible trajectorynnwith magic scifi engines that can output a high level of constant thrust indefinitely like 1 gs such as the epstein drive in the expanse the trajectory becomes a flip and burn scenario where the spacecraft accelerates toward the target for half the journey then flips around to decelerate for the second half journeys take days rather than months and the trajectory is nearly a straight linennthat was a rather longwinded introduction but my question is the following  imagine a ship has an onboard fusion reactor which powers some form of highly efficient electric propulsion this lets the ship accelerate essentially indefinitely but only at a fraction of a g lets say less than 1 ms2 or even less what shape does the optimal trajectory become gravity is no longer negligible as in the flip and burn scenario but the journey would still be far faster than a traditional transfer orbit with just a single burn at the start and end,0,2,2

0xd42,"> currently I’m doing maths chem and physics but do you think that’s enough to get a job that pays well?\n\nYes, but that depends on your definition of ""pays well"" and if you're willing to work a job that is unrelated to your major. I could have gone straight from grad school to a physics postdoc that would have paid $60k-$70k, but that just isn't enough money to satisfy me. My area of study in physics didn't line up well with physics industry (read: semiconductors and solid-state). So I left physics and sold my skills to the highest bidder.\n\nBig tech and big finance understand that there are many people who graduate with STEM degrees who want to go into non-STEM industry to make more money. I knew very little finance coming into my current finance job, and on a day-to-day basis I use very little finance in my current finance job. Everything I use is something that I learned on the job. My company doesn't care. They hired me because I'm smart, and then they taught me all the finance that I needed to do my job.\n\nThose majors demonstrate that you are at least somewhat smart. If you're smart, and you can demonstrate this in an interview, and you have some basic programming skills, then you can get a decent finance job. If you want to go into tech instead then you need better than ""basic"" programming skills. Statistically speaking, big finance and big tech are where STEM majors go if they don't want to work in STEM but want to make the most money, which is why I keep mentioning those two fields.\n\nEDIT: grammar",Physics, currently im doing maths chem and physics but do you think thats enough to get a job that pays wellnnyes but that depends on your definition of pays well and if youre willing to work a job that is unrelated to your major i could have gone straight from grad school to a physics postdoc that would have paid 60k70k but that just isnt enough money to satisfy me my area of study in physics didnt line up well with physics industry read semiconductors and solidstate so i left physics and sold my skills to the highest biddernnbig tech and big finance understand that there are many people who graduate with stem degrees who want to go into nonstem industry to make more money i knew very little finance coming into my current finance job and on a daytoday basis i use very little finance in my current finance job everything i use is something that i learned on the job my company doesnt care they hired me because im smart and then they taught me all the finance that i needed to do my jobnnthose majors demonstrate that you are at least somewhat smart if youre smart and you can demonstrate this in an interview and you have some basic programming skills then you can get a decent finance job if you want to go into tech instead then you need better than basic programming skills statistically speaking big finance and big tech are where stem majors go if they dont want to work in stem but want to make the most money which is why i keep mentioning those two fieldsnnedit grammar,2,2,0

0x5b4,"It’s unlikely we could have powered the initial industrial growth via renewable energy, and for the first 100 or so years we didn’t even have that much concern about human emissions causing the planet to warm. Obviously there were still serious issues associated with pollution and also the exploitation of workers and regions that produced oil. \n\nThat said, most of the historical emissions have been after sometime around 1950-1980 when people were already starting to worry about the impact of emissions on the earth’s temperature. In this sense, it is true that we chose to emit greenhouse gases over renewables because of a desire for growth and profit. I’m not sure how developed renewables were at the time, and clearly they were under developed because of a reliance on oil, but renewable energy and battery technology likely weren’t able to replace oil in the 70s or 80s because of how big of a head start oil had. If you look at solar, for example, NREL shows that IBM had one in the 1975 with around 22% efficiency, but the price in the 70s was way higher than it is now to the point where they couldn’t have replaced oil. It also wasn’t merely a profit thing because the high price is associated with a difficulty in manufacturing it in bulk. \n\nAll this aside, you don’t make a compelling case for why we shouldn’t try to capture CO2. Yes, we could have used renewables in the past to avoid CO2 emissions, but that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t try to capture CO2 with plants powered by renewables. Direct air capture from the atmosphere followed by sequestration is one of the few ways that we can reduce the CO2 that already has been emitted. Yes, we can use trees or other natural carbon capturing systems, but carbon capture materials can also play an important role in reducing atmospheric CO2 emissions. \n\nOne important issue with carbon capture and sequestration is that it is incredibly unprofitable (unlike what you said). You spend money capturing something from the atmosphere that is useful (you can burn it to generate energy) and then just bury it underground. You allude to how people want to profiteer off of carbon capture, and I agree with you related to things like capturing carbon from either a coal or natural gas plant and then burning it (this is currently done actually), or capturing it from the atmosphere and then burning it, but the only way carbon capture and sequestration would make you money would be if there were government incentives like a carbon tax or by the government just funding the operation of carbon capture plants.",Physics,its unlikely we could have powered the initial industrial growth via renewable energy and for the first 100 or so years we didnt even have that much concern about human emissions causing the planet to warm obviously there were still serious issues associated with pollution and also the exploitation of workers and regions that produced oil nnthat said most of the historical emissions have been after sometime around 19501980 when people were already starting to worry about the impact of emissions on the earths temperature in this sense it is true that we chose to emit greenhouse gases over renewables because of a desire for growth and profit im not sure how developed renewables were at the time and clearly they were under developed because of a reliance on oil but renewable energy and battery technology likely werent able to replace oil in the 70s or 80s because of how big of a head start oil had if you look at solar for example nrel shows that ibm had one in the 1975 with around 22 efficiency but the price in the 70s was way higher than it is now to the point where they couldnt have replaced oil it also wasnt merely a profit thing because the high price is associated with a difficulty in manufacturing it in bulk nnall this aside you dont make a compelling case for why we shouldnt try to capture co2 yes we could have used renewables in the past to avoid co2 emissions but that doesnt mean we shouldnt try to capture co2 with plants powered by renewables direct air capture from the atmosphere followed by sequestration is one of the few ways that we can reduce the co2 that already has been emitted yes we can use trees or other natural carbon capturing systems but carbon capture materials can also play an important role in reducing atmospheric co2 emissions nnone important issue with carbon capture and sequestration is that it is incredibly unprofitable unlike what you said you spend money capturing something from the atmosphere that is useful you can burn it to generate energy and then just bury it underground you allude to how people want to profiteer off of carbon capture and i agree with you related to things like capturing carbon from either a coal or natural gas plant and then burning it this is currently done actually or capturing it from the atmosphere and then burning it but the only way carbon capture and sequestration would make you money would be if there were government incentives like a carbon tax or by the government just funding the operation of carbon capture plants,1,2,0

A good CV and cover letter is an art, ideally you tailor each one to the job you are applying for.\n\nHiring managers can easily filter people out by who's paid attention when sending out CVs, the less generic the better, it's all about being memorable.\n\nMy advice, pick about 8 jobs you actually like, not just ""I'm applying because I need a job and have skills in chem"". Put the time and effort in to rewrite your CV, making sure to include key words listed on the job posting. Make sure to emphasise (key skill they are looking for) from X experience under the relevant experience. So before they call you to interview they don't have to spend any time thinking about whether your experience is relevant. Assume that the hiring manager is overworked. When you are done, you have EXACTLY 1 MINUTE to read your CV and decide whether you are a good candidate for the role. Best thing you can do is give the selection criteria to a friend and time how quickly they can tick off the key things the hiring people are looking for. (This is a true anecdote from a friend who does hiring for their company). \n\nMost people will filter you out at selection if you don't meet their entry criteria. If the general talent pool is applying with a master's or PhD, then you're probably not qualified for the role (not always the case, you can be overqualified too, some people don't want to hire a PhD when they could train a BSC to do the job for 5-10k less per year.\n\nEdit, sorry for formatting, mobile",Chemistry,60 applications with 2 interviews is a very low success rate there may be something systematic on your end that youre doingnot doing over your qualifications a good cv and cover letter is an art ideally you tailor each one to the job you are applying fornnhiring managers can easily filter people out by whos paid attention when sending out cvs the less generic the better its all about being memorablennmy advice pick about 8 jobs you actually like not just im applying because i need a job and have skills in chem put the time and effort in to rewrite your cv making sure to include key words listed on the job posting make sure to emphasise key skill they are looking for from x experience under the relevant experience so before they call you to interview they dont have to spend any time thinking about whether your experience is relevant assume that the hiring manager is overworked when you are done you have exactly 1 minute to read your cv and decide whether you are a good candidate for the role best thing you can do is give the selection criteria to a friend and time how quickly they can tick off the key things the hiring people are looking for this is a true anecdote from a friend who does hiring for their company nnmost people will filter you out at selection if you dont meet their entry criteria if the general talent pool is applying with a masters or phd then youre probably not qualified for the role not always the case you can be overqualified too some people dont want to hire a phd when they could train a bsc to do the job for 510k less per yearnnedit sorry for formatting mobile,2,1,0

In my professional life, I spent a lot of my time supporting students who were in the same place as you are now, so I can appreciate your concerns.\n\nStudying at University is a big change from school, so you may well find University challenging initially. That’s completely normal. You say you study hard, and I’m sure you do, but perhaps you need to rethink <how> you study. Do you just read through stuff repeatedly? Do you work through practice examples? If you have to do tests, do you work through practice tests? If you have to do essays, do you do practice essays? If you read through stuff, don’t just read it. It’s better to make lists of the main points that the book / website / resource is making, for example. That will help fix it in your memory and identify areas you’re not sure of - you can return to those later.\n\nI’d expect performance to improve as students progress from year to year, because they become more experienced in studying - in other words, their ‘study skills’ improve. In the UK, most universities would run study skills sessions for students, particularly in their first year: I don’t know if sessions like that are available in your institution. If there are, it might be helpful if you took part. How approachable are your tutors? It might also be worth speaking with them and asking their advice.\n\nA very big change to your programme of study needs careful consideration.

0x1896,"Simply put, inertia is the tendency of an object to keep doing what it's doing. Newton's first law of motion is also called the law of inertia commonly said as ""an object in motion stays in motion, and an object at rest stays at rest unless acted upon by an outside unbalanced force."" In classical mechanics, gravity is just another force so if the gravitational force isn't balanced out by some other force then the object will accelerate according to Newton's second law.\n\nYou can also think of inertia as related to mass. It is harder to slow down a train moving at 50 m/s than it is to slow down a ball of paper moving at 50 m/s. And an object moving 1000 km/s in deep space (i.e. away from the influence of other objects' gravity) will continue to move 1000 km/s in the same direction until something changes that. \n\nPhysicists sometimes distinguish between inertial mass and gravitational mass though experimentally they've always been measured to be the same thing. In this case, inertial mass is the mass you see in Newton's second law when written as F=ma and gravitational mass creating the gravitational potential in the equation U = -Gm/r. Inertial mass would relate a force on an object to its overall acceleration whereas gravitational mass determines how much gravity an object has. Though again as far as we can tell they're the same.\n\nInertia also increases without bound as you push an object closer and closer to the speed of light. In other words, it gets harder and harder to speed up an object as you push it closer and closer to the speed of light.\n\nA final note on inertia there's also rotational inertia, which is the rotational analog of mass. Something with a higher moment of inertia is both harder to start spinning and harder to stop spinning. Moment of inertia (the official name for rotational inertia) depends not only on the mass of the object but also the distribution of mass away from the axis of rotation. A simple demonstration to see this is to take a meterstick and twirl it around its center vs trying to twirl it with the same force about one end. It's a lot harder to sping around one end because the mass is on average further away from the axis of rotation.",Physics,simply put inertia is the tendency of an object to keep doing what its doing newtons first law of motion is also called the law of inertia commonly said as an object in motion stays in motion and an object at rest stays at rest unless acted upon by an outside unbalanced force in classical mechanics gravity is just another force so if the gravitational force isnt balanced out by some other force then the object will accelerate according to newtons second lawnnyou can also think of inertia as related to mass it is harder to slow down a train moving at 50 ms than it is to slow down a ball of paper moving at 50 ms and an object moving 1000 kms in deep space ie away from the influence of other objects gravity will continue to move 1000 kms in the same direction until something changes that nnphysicists sometimes distinguish between inertial mass and gravitational mass though experimentally theyve always been measured to be the same thing in this case inertial mass is the mass you see in newtons second law when written as fma and gravitational mass creating the gravitational potential in the equation u  gmr inertial mass would relate a force on an object to its overall acceleration whereas gravitational mass determines how much gravity an object has though again as far as we can tell theyre the samenninertia also increases without bound as you push an object closer and closer to the speed of light in other words it gets harder and harder to speed up an object as you push it closer and closer to the speed of lightnna final note on inertia theres also rotational inertia which is the rotational analog of mass something with a higher moment of inertia is both harder to start spinning and harder to stop spinning moment of inertia the official name for rotational inertia depends not only on the mass of the object but also the distribution of mass away from the axis of rotation a simple demonstration to see this is to take a meterstick and twirl it around its center vs trying to twirl it with the same force about one end its a lot harder to sping around one end because the mass is on average further away from the axis of rotation,0,2,2

0x2533,"The answer to that is kind of complicated, I’m no expert but I’ll do my best to explain. A ceramic is pretty much a 3-dimensional matrix material arranged in a graphitic-type structure. It is generally made of silica and/or carbon mostly but there are plenty of other things that could be inside - mostly inorganic stuff like metals. They have characteristics like no glass transition temperature (which can kind of be thought of as a melting temperature in a layman sense), brittleness (because the chemical structure is highly croslinked and there arent many ways for the molecule to move and deflect energy, so it will simply break instead), heat resistance, and chemical/corrosion resistance. Ceramics can be made in many different ways, but my favorite type of ceramics are polymer-derived ceramics. In this method, you can take a silica based polymer and you basically just heat it up. At first the polymer crosslinks into a 3d shape, locking the shape in place. Then it pyrolyzes, where the less stable molecular structures are broken apart and volatilize out of the material. At high temperatures (like 1300 C) the bonds between the atoms are breaking chaotically and rearranging, and you end up with these carbon-rich domains which are basically graphite (this process is called graphitization) and silica rich domains. There are ways you can control the morphology to dramatically improve certain mechanical properties, but that gets into some complicated stuff.\n\nOh, and Ill add that a cool thing about polymer derived ceramics is that you can 3d print them, which is SUPER valuable for making intricate geometries like rocket engine components.",Chemistry,the answer to that is kind of complicated im no expert but ill do my best to explain a ceramic is pretty much a 3dimensional matrix material arranged in a graphitictype structure it is generally made of silica andor carbon mostly but there are plenty of other things that could be inside  mostly inorganic stuff like metals they have characteristics like no glass transition temperature which can kind of be thought of as a melting temperature in a layman sense brittleness because the chemical structure is highly croslinked and there arent many ways for the molecule to move and deflect energy so it will simply break instead heat resistance and chemicalcorrosion resistance ceramics can be made in many different ways but my favorite type of ceramics are polymerderived ceramics in this method you can take a silica based polymer and you basically just heat it up at first the polymer crosslinks into a 3d shape locking the shape in place then it pyrolyzes where the less stable molecular structures are broken apart and volatilize out of the material at high temperatures like 1300 c the bonds between the atoms are breaking chaotically and rearranging and you end up with these carbonrich domains which are basically graphite this process is called graphitization and silica rich domains there are ways you can control the morphology to dramatically improve certain mechanical properties but that gets into some complicated stuffnnoh and ill add that a cool thing about polymer derived ceramics is that you can 3d print them which is super valuable for making intricate geometries like rocket engine components,1,1,0

The bigger the dish, the more energy it can redirect.\n\nIn reverse, a parabolic reflector can also create a “beam” of sound from a point source. This is not amplification, but it does optimise the energy that is there in a particular direction.\n\nAnother aspect is the efficiency of acoustic coupling. A vibrating membrane might have a certain power, but if it’s coupled poorly to the air, it won’t produce much sound. Certain shapes can vastly improve this efficiency. It does not “amplify”, but it does make sure that what energy is there is transferred to the air efficiently. This is the purpose of horns such as on acoustic gramophone players, brass musical instruments, PA speakers, etc. The best shape is an exponential horn that forms a smooth impedance match between the original source of vibration and the air.

If you really want to know more specific details such as where do each wave function comes from and how to write them you'll have to look on a quantum mechanics books, the expressions can get quite extensive.   \nWith that in mind, the squares can be easilly associated with the probability densities (squared wave function), since that is what you'll be seeing the orbital plots, and with some (really large) degree of freedom of speech, try to imagine the xy, xz, zy as solutions where the variables are correlated, justifying the fact that is never purely in the x or y (and so on) axis. For the x\^2 - y\^2 think of them as a linear combination of non-correlated variables to form the general solution, thus the highest probability wont be on a region where the (x\^2 , y\^2) combination is at it's maximum but where either (x\^2 , 0) or (0, y\^2) is being maximized.   \nThe biggest problem with this analogy comes from the z\^2 - r\^2 one, here you'll need to have some revolution solids in mind, since it's quite easy to see that the density regions are separated by a 3-dimensional cone instead of a traditional cartesian axis, that's where the r\^2 may help to visualize its formation. Try plotting a surface such as z\^2 - x\^2 - y\^2 and note that the 3d z\^2 solution lies inside the cone and around it.   \nHowever, do realize, this is just an (way) overly simplified justification, you'll need to check the wavefunction solution for each case to really get a picture of whats going on behind the scene and it's now that hard to find a table of such solutions.

0x853,"First, the argument that they make is not the same as the argument you made (even if their conclusion is similar). They make no mention of the source of the CO2 emissions. They only refer to the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere. At least they understand that what put the CO2 in the atmosphere doesn’t matter. Hopefully you finally agree with this after sharing this link?\n\nSecond, while their conclusion is that the theoretical limit costs more energy to capture carbon than was gained when it was emitted, this directly contradicts the claim made in one of the papers I sent above. That paper claimed that it is theoretically possible (based on thermodynamics) to use a fossil fuel energy source to capture carbon and still have net negative emissions. I’m more inclined to trust the analysis coming from people who specialize in the thermodynamics of gas separations and also who published it on a peer review journal than a post on someone’s substack, even if that person has a PhD in physics. It is possible, however, that the analysis from the 2005 paper represents a theoretical limit that cannot be reached. “Economic and energetic analysis of capturing CO2 from ambient air” (which is cited in the blog post you sent) estimates that with a 5% second law efficiency (they note that real world processes typically have a 5-40% efficiency), the energy costs associated with capturing CO2 from the air is similar to the energy gained from natural gas. If a carbon capture technology were more efficient (and it is theoretically possible for it to be more efficient based on arguments in this same paper), then it would be feasible to power direct air capture with a natural gas plant and still have negative emissions, and if it were powered with renewables then it would be even better in terms of the CO2 reduction. \n\nUltimately, it is true that carbon capture is an energy intensive process. It is not, however, true that the relevant quantity to consider in evaluating the thermodynamics of carbon capture is the energy gained from the initial CO2 emissions. It just so happens that the actual thermodynamic process that is relevant (that of the adsorption and desorption of CO2, which is what I’ve been saying all along) happens to give you a similar amount of energy required for capture as natural gas generates for the same amount of CO2 emitted if you assume that the process has a second law efficiency of 5%. There’s nothing saying the second law efficiency can’t be better than 5%, and also it doesn’t matter that a lot of historic emissions have been from sources besides natural gas (like coal) which emit more CO2 per unit of energy generated. In the argument you were making where the source mattered, these coal emissions would be relevant in addition to other sources. This might seem like a small point, but the main thing we have been discussing is what is the theoretical limit of CO2 capture and what is the relevant thermodynamic process to consider for it, and you were mistaken in thinking the initial emission process was relevant. Perhaps you think that the 5% second law efficiency won’t be bested, in which case the energy use for direct air capture would probably be prohibitive; this is a reasonable thing to believe, and it seems like there are people who are knowledgeable about gas separations who believe it, but it is very different from claiming that direct air capture could never be feasible because the thermodynamics of it could never be favorable. The fact that it could be feasible is why it is a very active topic of research.\n\nEdit: I was looking back through the DAC review article that I initially sent, and wanted to conclude with adding this quotation “Lackner thus concluded that the potential for greater efficiencies with DAC closes the gap in energy requirements between the two processes and suggests that arguments of DAC being unfeasible due to large energy demands compared to flue gas capture may not be accurate.” In the paragraphs following this quotation, the review article discusses different argument made by different papers regarding the energy required in an actual material. They are not all on agreement, and the process is complicated enough that the various approaches from each paper often have drawbacks that could limit the accuracy of their estimates. Clearly, there is debate about the energy requirements of DAC. Some scientists/experts think it the technology won’t be able to get efficient enough, while others think that it can. I don’t think any of the experts think that it is thermodynamically impossible though, just that some think efficiencies might not be able to get close enough to the thermodynamic limit to make DAC reasonably cheap.

If a species finds a stable niche that doesn't entirely disappear during episodes of mass extinction, it can remain morphologically similar for hundreds of millions of years.\n\nMost selection, at most times, drives species to remain near their local optimum in the fitness landscape. This equilibrium is punctuated by bursts of rapid evolution when the environment changes dramatically and the selection pressures a species is subject to change, or in small isolated populations where genetic drift can mean a random walk across the fitness landscape.\n\nAnd even in species that seem morphologically similar to those that existed hundreds of million years ago, there can be substantial evolution. Most organisms are in a ""Red Queen's"" race with faster evolving parasites and pathogens, so even though their gross appearance may match an unchanging local optimum of the fitness landscape, they probably had major changes to immune response, which wouldn't be visible in the fossile record.\n\nMy understanding is that the nautiluses we find today are scarcely distinguishable from some nautiloids that existed prior to the end Permian mass extinction, and morphologically similar to nautiloids from 500 Mya.

0xc6e,"So it's a laymen's term and my apologies,  but I try not to get too far into minute details on reddit threads out of fear it won't be fully understood by everyone reading it.\n\nWhen vaccinated, your immune system is ""boosted"" - hence the term ""boost"" or ""booster"" for the vaccine. You get a ""surge"", rapid increase, peak, whatever you want to call it to have it make sense to you (as a virologist, immunologist, entomologist, a new worried father, what have you), shortly after your immune system is stimulated. You would therefore after a vaccination ""booster"" get a ""surge"" or sudden increase in circulating antibodies. In this case for a booster it would be IgG antibodies over IgM, or even in this specific case of a pregnant/post-partum/breast-feeding mother IgA antibodies as it's present in her bodily fluids, but I digress.\n\nThen after a period of time the antibodies go down to almost undetectable levels. There's vast variations in the populations and within individuals, so saying that they go to ""0"" is not entirely accurate. In this day and age with there being no herd immunity, vaccine hesitation and resistance, etc., it's quite possible any particular person may have some level of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies circulating at any point in time. That's why there's ""baseline"" with testing depending on the type of test done and what has been used as a control to establish that test. I've worked in a variety of laboratories and for instance, there's one influenza variant, let's call it variant A, that if your antibody titer is 1:8 or higher, you are considered immune to that virus (1 portion of your serum had enough antibodies present to bind to virus when mixed with blood and diluted at a ratio of 1:8). But let's also say there's another influenza variant, called B, that's a bit more funky, so we consider a titer of 1:16 or 1:32 protective. Or better yet, it's an H5-based influenza virus, in which case it's highly debated if HAI testing is even a good determinant of protective antibody response at all.

Every day life is about electrons, photons, up quarks, down quarks, and gluons. You could maybe make a case to include muons\n\n>The search failed to find the particle, known as the sterile neutrino.\n\nokay, sort of true, but really they didn't test neutrino oscillations, they tested the MiniBooNE low energy excess and disfavored that at solid significance.\n\n> This will now direct physicists towards even more interesting theories to help explain how the Universe came to be.\n\nthis is just making things up.\n\n>That is because a sizeable proportion of physicists have been developing their theories on the basis that the existence of the sterile neutrino was a possibility. \n\nThis is highly misleading: this result does not rule out sterile neutrinos, nor does it rule 1 eV sterile neutrinos, rather it does not find evidence for the low energy excess that MiniBooNE saw which was often interpreted as evidence for a sterile neutrino. Sterile neutrinos could still exist at 1 eV but with smaller mixing with active neutrinos, or sterile neutrino could exist at any other mass range (likely heavier), or both.

It's worth noting that the agar that OP used (NBB-A) states in the user manual that it is ""Nutrient media for the detection of Beer-spoiling microorganisms (esp. Lactobacilli, Pediococci, *Pectinatus* and *Megasphaera*) in filtered beer samples.""\n>*Pectinatus* [Pec.ti.na′tus. L. part. adj. *pectinatus* combed (bacteria)].\n\n>Cells are non-spore-forming, slightly curved to helical rods, 0·4–0·9×2–50 μm or more, with rounded ends and a Gram-negative cell wall. They occur singly, in pairs or rarely in short chains. Cells are usually motile by means of comb-like flagellation which emanates from only one side of a cell. Cadaverine or putrescine is found in the cell-wall peptidoglycan. Organisms are strictly anaerobic mesophiles with fermentative metabolism. Glucose and fructose are mainly metabolized to acetic and propionic acids. H2S and acetoin and occasionally minor amounts of succinic acid are produced. Cells do not synthesize cytochrome oxidase, desulfoviridin or indole, hydrolyse arginine or gelatin or reduce nitrate. The G+C content of the DNA is 38–41 mol%.

0x2342,"My brother is the nuclear engineer so I know more than the average chemist but I'm no expert. I'm still reasonably certain that this is wrong. You don't really input energy into a nuclear reactor. You have fuel rods that will always and constantly give off neutrons. You use neutron moderators, usually coolant as water, to thermalize the neutrons and slow them down. Slower neutrons are more likely to collide with uranium for more reactions. Then you use reflectors and absorbers like beryllium and boron, respectively, to control how many neutrons there are around the fuel rods. At no point did I have to input any energy to cause the uranium to decay and give off neutrons. It's just doing what it would do anyways, and I'm controlling it with external factors. \n\nSo from that standpoint, I think the key things for the chemistry of your fuel rods are factors like density of your actual fuel (ie crystal structure), it's propensity to form cracks during it's lifetime, thermal expansion, etc etc. Even if this couterion neutron capture is an issue, I think it would take a back seat to the other factors and be relatively minor.

When we set out with a bias, it’s difficult to conduct experiments without bringing that bias along. \nI listened to most of the 300 episodes of a NDE podcast over the last several years. I find it fascinating because everyone’s experience is unique but they all flow very similarly. Regardless of gender, race, location, culture, or creed - people have extremely similar “spiritual” experiences when they experience an NDE or psychoactive compound. Whether it’s LSD where eyes are open, or DMT with closed eyes while seeing more vividly than ever imagined…the experiences are so strikingly similar. With DMT, why would people see the same “entities” even if they’ve never heard reference of them beforehand? I’m not saying that with DMT you go off on an astral trip and meet inter-dimensional beings. But what IS happening? HOW are our humans brains so alike that we hallucinate the exact same ridiculous looking things in an altered state? How have people completely healed themselves from addictions after “meeting Mother Auyhuasca”? How is that we can consume a substance that causes us to dig into the depths of our psyche and rearrange things so that we can function more easily and understand the world more clearly? There is insurmountable evidence if more than a few scientists would study it and if it wasn’t so damn Taboo to talk about. \n\nIt’s precisely because it’s considered woowoo that there isn’t more in-depth research on the topic or at least not that the public is allowed to know about. It’s precisely why psilocybin, DMT, LSD, and even cannabis have been deemed schedule 1 drugs. Because it usually changes the way we see the world. It usually causes us to “wake up”, from this dumb broken system we’ve created. Why does it do that? Well, we don’t really NEED to understand the why to see that it does, regardless of our understanding. But I do believe we will understand it better someday. Whatever it is, it IS scientific and it just IS the way things are. Either we as humans have the ability to hallucinate the same experiences and exact images as strangers across the globe, or it’s a spiritual experience suggesting that there is way more than just this earthly plane of existence. It’s one of those two things and they are both really freaking cool. If science helps discover the truth, and if spirituality is also the truth, then I expect in the future we will come to accept that they complement each other well. But there is no room for religion (not even the “religion” of faith in science, because it’s still done by man’s hand) when it comes to progress. \n\nObserve and wonder.

0x1aeb,"ABS is not UV stable.  Chemical inhibitors are added during manufacture.\n\nWhen the plastic ages, the UV absorbers stop working and an oxygen molecule will snatch a single hydrogen atom from the plastic molecule.  The molecule then slightly re-arranges into a yellow coloured new molecule.  Overall: the plastic has irreversibly lost a small part of itself but not enough to change the size of the brick.\n\nAdding peroxide + UV introduces more even stronger radicals - BAM! kick it up a notch.  They attack the yellow polymer only at the site that is missing a hydrogen atom and essentially chop it in half. No more yellow coloured molecule.\n\nDownside is the polymer is no longer elastic.  It's brittle.

Im not trying to be condescending but you would do yourself a huge favor by getting a better grasp on chemistry before trying to grasp molecular biology.  At this point you are asking things that are explained in middle school science classes before they even call the class chemistry, or at least my middle school called it Science class.  A gas has atoms less densely packed than a liquid or solid.  A nebulizer  uses an atomizer to disperse the drug and in turn and intrinsically turns it into a gas or at least decreases the droplet size small enough to be inhaled without choking.  The less mass something has the less effect gravity has on it.  Something under about 80nm is uneffected by gravity.  Although the droplets are larger than this they do have such little mass at those sizes that they are temporarily suspended in air.  This is essentially a fog not steam.  Of course steam is acting on similar principles and is also lifted into the air by thermodynamics. Speaking of your earlier example of liquids those are suspensions in liquids usually mostly water with some flavoring to make it easier to swallow whereas a nebulizer or inhaler is a suspension in air. Gases mix homogeneously without even mixing like a liquid.  At this point it is getting a bit difficult to explain to you because you are requiring an explanation of underpinnings that should be understood and implied.  Again see basic chemistry and physics.

Time is still passing for me, but the distance I travel approaches zero as I get closer to the speed of light. At the speed of light, then, the distance *is* zero. Better, points at lightlike separation are a distance zero from each other in the Minkowski metric.\n\nThe implication that confuses the OP, then, is that this means that, in the reference frame of a photon, it exists for only an instant: It is instantaneously transmitted from its origin to its destination, and thus in its frame *no time passes*. In our frame of course it takes time for the light to move, because light doesn't move infinitely fast and the distance between its origin and its destination *isn't* zero. In the photon's frame that distance *is* zero. This is indeed strange, for it says that a photon ""sees"" the universe as flat, with all distances parallel to its direction of travel shrunk to zero; and as far as the photon is concerned it seems not to exist for any time at all.\n\nTo that all I can say is that photons aren't people; they seem to get along with their weird lives with little worry.

0x1937,"Okay so this is a tough question, let me try to bring some light to it.\nSo, the issue here lies with the interpretation on Quantum Mechanics. QM postulates describe how do systems work. They are true (as far as we know), but they don't give a further explanation as to why is the world like this. These postulates describe how measurements are performed by an observer on a quantum system. The measurement collapses the wave function at the moment of the measurement. And the instants before and after the measurement, the system can go back to its usual probabilistic behaviour. However, what does it mean to perform a measurement? The measurement gives a concrete value to a magnitude (it could be energy, speed, position... of the system). Usually, we consider collisions between particles or semiparticles to be measurements, since, in the limit, they are two different systems that interact and preserve the energy and momentum equations(if they are coupled we cannot apply it but for the sake of our argument we'll toss it under the carpet). So, in these cases, even if there's no evident observer, there is indeed a measurement performed in the systems. \nThis means that you don't need to have intelligent observer to collapse a wavefunction.\n\nHowever, if we say the whole universe is a closed system that has a huuuuuge wave function, one could argue that there are only partial observations but the whole universe wavefunction isn't collapsed. Then, you could say that everything is in a quantum state and is in fact governed by qm laws as a wave. What happens with all the other possible discarded states (universes in this case) is a bigger question that has no answer and that messes with the interpretations of qm.\n\nTL;DR: we don't need intelligent observers to collapse wave functions, the universe is and will be a quantum state\n\nHope it was useful:)",Physics,okay so this is a tough question let me try to bring some light to itnso the issue here lies with the interpretation on quantum mechanics qm postulates describe how do systems work they are true as far as we know but they dont give a further explanation as to why is the world like this these postulates describe how measurements are performed by an observer on a quantum system the measurement collapses the wave function at the moment of the measurement and the instants before and after the measurement the system can go back to its usual probabilistic behaviour however what does it mean to perform a measurement the measurement gives a concrete value to a magnitude it could be energy speed position of the system usually we consider collisions between particles or semiparticles to be measurements since in the limit they are two different systems that interact and preserve the energy and momentum equationsif they are coupled we cannot apply it but for the sake of our argument well toss it under the carpet so in these cases even if theres no evident observer there is indeed a measurement performed in the systems nthis means that you dont need to have intelligent observer to collapse a wavefunctionnnhowever if we say the whole universe is a closed system that has a huuuuuge wave function one could argue that there are only partial observations but the whole universe wavefunction isnt collapsed then you could say that everything is in a quantum state and is in fact governed by qm laws as a wave what happens with all the other possible discarded states universes in this case is a bigger question that has no answer and that messes with the interpretations of qmnntldr we dont need intelligent observers to collapse wave functions the universe is and will be a quantum statennhope it was useful,0,2,2

(hence the comparison of distance to xenon and radon is a bit inaccurate) A very important aspect is the inert pair effect of s-electrons. It simply states that as you go to higher rows, e. g within the 3rd main group from boron to aluminium to gallium to indium and finally to thallium, the s-electrons become increasingly more difficult to access. The effect originates from quantum mechanics. This means in essence that the tendency of being most stable in the +I compared to the +III state increases with increasing mass of the element. In other words, removing both s-electrons from the valence shell of thallium is more difficult than for indium, gallium, aluminium or boron. (The same trend applies also to the 4th and somewhat to the 5th main group) Negative oxidation states are for  elements of the 3rd main group exceedingly rare, because their electromegativities are relatively low. This means that the valence shell of thallium for example is barely capable of accommodating one additional electron. negatively charged thallium ions are therefore rarely formed.

0x20c0,"One should keep in mind that most dark matter ""alternatives"", including this one, actually include dark matter. It says so right on the 2nd page of their paper:\n\n> Consider requirement (iii), that is, successful cosmology. In (2) we have a new d.o.f. φ [...] What should the expectation for a cosmological evolution of ϕ be? The MOND law for galaxies is silent regarding this matter. There is, however, another empirical law which concerns cosmology: the existence of sizable amounts of energy density scaling precisely as a^(−3).\n\nIn other words, they are saying that to get the cosmology right, they need to add dark matter -- that is what they are alluding to with the ""sizable amounts of energy"". They make their φ field play this role. It's just like TeVeS, the other major relativistic MOND theory, where the scalar ""S"" field does the same thing.\n\nThe popular press likes to frame the debate as ""dark matter vs. modified gravity"", but it's really ""dark matter vs. dark matter plus modified gravity"". The hope is that adding a modification of gravity will help fit the galaxy rotation curves better, at the cost of higher theoretical complexity. If you read the paper, the authors aren’t trying to do away with dark matter at all — their primary achievement is getting their modified gravity theory to work out despite the many theoretical obstacles.\n\n---\n\nEdit: I also feel like I should respond to the other top comment which complains modifying gravity is ""less elegant"" than dark matter. These days, dark matter models are not about elegance at all, they're about minimality: trying to account for it by adding just one or two kinds of particles, with the simplest possible interactions, focusing on the dumbest possible first guess. There was an era where people to make dark matter ""elegantly"" fall out as a secondary consequence of adding 100 new particles in a grand theory that also solved every other problem in the Standard Model at once, but that ship has sailed because those theories didn't work. As scientists we should just follow the evidence, without theoretical prejudice. It just so happens that at the moment most of the evidence points towards dark matter.",Physics,one should keep in mind that most dark matter alternatives including this one actually include dark matter it says so right on the 2nd page of their papernn consider requirement iii that is successful cosmology in 2 we have a new dof φ  what should the expectation for a cosmological evolution of ϕ be the mond law for galaxies is silent regarding this matter there is however another empirical law which concerns cosmology the existence of sizable amounts of energy density scaling precisely as a3nnin other words they are saying that to get the cosmology right they need to add dark matter  that is what they are alluding to with the sizable amounts of energy they make their φ field play this role its just like teves the other major relativistic mond theory where the scalar s field does the same thingnnthe popular press likes to frame the debate as dark matter vs modified gravity but its really dark matter vs dark matter plus modified gravity the hope is that adding a modification of gravity will help fit the galaxy rotation curves better at the cost of higher theoretical complexity if you read the paper the authors arent trying to do away with dark matter at all  their primary achievement is getting their modified gravity theory to work out despite the many theoretical obstaclesnnnnedit i also feel like i should respond to the other top comment which complains modifying gravity is less elegant than dark matter these days dark matter models are not about elegance at all theyre about minimality trying to account for it by adding just one or two kinds of particles with the simplest possible interactions focusing on the dumbest possible first guess there was an era where people to make dark matter elegantly fall out as a secondary consequence of adding 100 new particles in a grand theory that also solved every other problem in the standard model at once but that ship has sailed because those theories didnt work as scientists we should just follow the evidence without theoretical prejudice it just so happens that at the moment most of the evidence points towards dark matter,0,2,2

0x1d6e,"Well, it depends on the situation. Generally I'd say the quote as stated is not wrong (it's imprecise, as it is a statement in words and not one in mathematics, but it's at least not wrong). \n\nThere are situations where a quantum system is in only one state. We might not know in what state it is, but it's definitely in one and only one state.\n\nIn other situations a quantum system can be in a superposition of multiple states (that can be all possible states, it can also be only two of many possible states). A superposition of multiple states is what popular science calls ""in many states at once"" (one can definitely discuss how accurate this description is, but I think it's the most accurate, non-mathematical, description one can give). If you measure such a superposition state you will however only observe one of the states that made up the superposition (much like the example of the cat, that's why I said: if a cat was a quantum system the example would be true).\n\nWhich of the two situations apply, depends on your experimental setup. The important thing is that the measurement statistics of these two situations are different. If you give me a quantum system, and don't tell me whether it's in one state (but don't tell me which) or whether it's in a superposition af multiple states, I will be able to tell.

0x1f5c,"Okay that makes more sense to me. In that case, it's either a kinetic or thermodynamic thing. It's probably not kinetic but just in case, you could try cooling it more slowly. Idk what the water content is in the microwave so either inject it into hot water and let cool or let it cool and then inject it into the regular water. I don't think this will work but maybe.\n\nOtherwise, the issue seems to be one of partitioning. You have 2 phases, either stearic acid in the SLN or the lipid tails of the tween 20. As is, they are virtually identical. Both are totally unsaturated long carbon chains. Could you try altering composition of the lipid core to make a more distinct difference in phase? Clotrimazole is highly aromatic so while it will dissolve in aliphatic substances, it should still prefer aromatic substances. If you can up the aromatic content of your SLN, it might stay in place more. Aromatic body friendly things seem rare though. Cholesterols or some unsaturated fats maybe? Some vitamin B's or E look promising. Tryptophan might even work. \n\nCome to think of it, the whole thing is weird to me. It's a little weird that you have SLN's and micelles both existing. It seems like there's just too much surfactant as it means your covering the SLN's entirely and still have enough left over to be above the cmc. But the other bit that's weird is that a drug dissolved in a SOLID lipid core is partitioning into the micelle phase. If it's solid, it shouldn't really move and definitely not partition into a micelle phase. So... kinetics might not actually be far off. I was thinking of micelle formation before but you might need to worry about the SLN formation. If you can get the SLN's formed before diluting, you should be golden. But I'm guessing that's the whole cold water step and it will fail otherwise. I'm kind of curious what happens if you just microwave the drug and stearic acid by themselves and then inject them straight into water. It will fall out of solution, but if it forms the right sized particles, you might be able to add your tween 20 after the fact and with some mixing and/or sonication, resuspend the stearic acid mixture. Even if you are forming micelles, it should be solid already and avoid the issue. But it might not form the right size particles or resist resuspension. Who knows? Concentration is still probably the best bet.",Chemistry,okay that makes more sense to me in that case its either a kinetic or thermodynamic thing its probably not kinetic but just in case you could try cooling it more slowly idk what the water content is in the microwave so either inject it into hot water and let cool or let it cool and then inject it into the regular water i dont think this will work but maybennotherwise the issue seems to be one of partitioning you have 2 phases either stearic acid in the sln or the lipid tails of the tween 20 as is they are virtually identical both are totally unsaturated long carbon chains could you try altering composition of the lipid core to make a more distinct difference in phase clotrimazole is highly aromatic so while it will dissolve in aliphatic substances it should still prefer aromatic substances if you can up the aromatic content of your sln it might stay in place more aromatic body friendly things seem rare though cholesterols or some unsaturated fats maybe some vitamin bs or e look promising tryptophan might even work nncome to think of it the whole thing is weird to me its a little weird that you have slns and micelles both existing it seems like theres just too much surfactant as it means your covering the slns entirely and still have enough left over to be above the cmc but the other bit thats weird is that a drug dissolved in a solid lipid core is partitioning into the micelle phase if its solid it shouldnt really move and definitely not partition into a micelle phase so kinetics might not actually be far off i was thinking of micelle formation before but you might need to worry about the sln formation if you can get the slns formed before diluting you should be golden but im guessing thats the whole cold water step and it will fail otherwise im kind of curious what happens if you just microwave the drug and stearic acid by themselves and then inject them straight into water it will fall out of solution but if it forms the right sized particles you might be able to add your tween 20 after the fact and with some mixing andor sonication resuspend the stearic acid mixture even if you are forming micelles it should be solid already and avoid the issue but it might not form the right size particles or resist resuspension who knows concentration is still probably the best bet,1,1,0

0x14b2,"As I learned from Carl Sagan, we can't comprehend 4D, but we can calculate it's ""shadow."" \n\nFor example, a creature in Flat Land that can only experience 2 dimensions will not be able to comprehend a cube, BUT, it CAN comprehend the SHADOW of the cube as projected onto its 2D world. From the creature's point of view, the object is not a collection of equal sides and angles, like a cube is supposed to be, but rather, the creature sees two differently sized squares linked together (just like a drawing of a cube).  \n\nLike the creature, we cannot see or comprehend a cube in the 4th dimension, but we can comprehend its shadow as projected onto our 3D world. A tesseract, as it's called, is simply a small cube centered within a larger cube with the vertices connected. From our perspective, the cubes are not equal sizes and the connection points are not equal to the sides of the squares, but regardless of our perception, it is a perfectly equilateral object in the 4th dimension, and each face is its own cube. We know this because, in order to create a 4th dimensional cube (tesseract), you would have to take 3D cubes and seperate them equally across a brand new direction, one that does not exist in our reality (just like ""up"" and ""down"" are brand new directions that do not exist in the reality of the Flat Worlder).\n\nMy point is, a virtual reality experience of the 4th dimension would still be grounded in the 3rd, because that's all we can experience.

Your DNA is inside the nucleus of the cell and whenever something needs to be expressed, a copy of the DNA is made and then transported out of the nucleus. When it's transported out, it's the mRNA form. It's the same here, except being made in the cell's nucleus, it's introduced via a shot. As far as I know, it's the same mechanism that stops excessive expression.\n\nHmm.. so I'm not an expert, but this doesnt sound right. the mRNA isn't anything but a message for your body. Your body uses that message to produce proteins that the rest of your body will then fight off. I think the concern is that there's no way to control the amount of proteins your body creates so SOME people create a massive amount of proteins which end up collecting in certain parts of the body. \n\nWhat is ""excessive expression""?\n\n>There's nothing to support that.

0x27a3,"You make some fair points, but I’m a little unsure about your main argument. \n\nAre you saying that all of the energy gained from the past 100-150 years of burning fossil fuels would have to be used to capture the CO2 in the atmosphere, and that we won’t be able to generate that much energy because we will also have to be powering society with renewables? If this isn’t what you’re saying, then I just misunderstood, but as far as I’m aware, I don’t think that this is right. \n\nFirst, over time we have been gradually getting more energy for the amount of emissions that are produced. Natural gas flue streams have much less CO2 than coal streams, making carbon capture from them more difficult (you allude to this in your comment above), but also meaning that we could be getting more energy per emissions out of natural gas than coal. I don’t know if the natural gas gives less energy than coal so it balances out to be the same energy per emissions (if so, I would be interested in seeing a source on this). Also, either way I agree we shouldn’t be using fossil fuels for energy. I’m not a “clean coal” or natural gas advocate. \n\nSecond, different materials require different energy inputs to adsorb and to release CO2. It’s not a fixed cost for every material. I can’t tell if I’m missing some basic thermodynamic argument for why the energy cost to capture must equal the energy cost to release, because we aren’t trying to “unburn the coal.” Initially we had coal -> energy and CO2, but now we are trying to go from CO2 -> something that isn’t coal. This can be CO2 bound to amines in aqueous amine solutions or CO2 bound to some calcium compound among other things, but I don’t think the energy required for the adsorption has to be equal to the initial energy used.",Physics,you make some fair points but im a little unsure about your main argument nnare you saying that all of the energy gained from the past 100150 years of burning fossil fuels would have to be used to capture the co2 in the atmosphere and that we wont be able to generate that much energy because we will also have to be powering society with renewables if this isnt what youre saying then i just misunderstood but as far as im aware i dont think that this is right nnfirst over time we have been gradually getting more energy for the amount of emissions that are produced natural gas flue streams have much less co2 than coal streams making carbon capture from them more difficult you allude to this in your comment above but also meaning that we could be getting more energy per emissions out of natural gas than coal i dont know if the natural gas gives less energy than coal so it balances out to be the same energy per emissions if so i would be interested in seeing a source on this also either way i agree we shouldnt be using fossil fuels for energy im not a clean coal or natural gas advocate nnsecond different materials require different energy inputs to adsorb and to release co2 its not a fixed cost for every material i cant tell if im missing some basic thermodynamic argument for why the energy cost to capture must equal the energy cost to release because we arent trying to unburn the coal initially we had coal  energy and co2 but now we are trying to go from co2  something that isnt coal this can be co2 bound to amines in aqueous amine solutions or co2 bound to some calcium compound among other things but i dont think the energy required for the adsorption has to be equal to the initial energy used,1,2,0

I would assume he knows this, but what it boils down to really is how much contact you have with people, which he isn't saying.\n\n>The mRNA gets replicated in the cell's cytoplasm/ribosome. Your DNA is inside the nucleus of the cell and whenever something needs to be expressed, a copy of the DNA is made and then transported out of the nucleus. When it's transported out, it's the mRNA form. It's the same here, except being made in the cell's nucleus, it's introduced via a shot. As far as I know, it's the same mechanism that stops excessive expression.\n\nHmm.. so I'm not an expert, but this doesnt sound right. the mRNA isn't anything but a message for your body. Your body uses that message to produce proteins that the rest of your body will then fight off. I think the concern is that there's no way to control the amount of proteins your body creates so SOME people create a massive amount of proteins which end up collecting in certain parts of the body. \n\nWhat is ""excessive expression""?\n\n>There's nothing to support that. Nothing scientific, not even theoretical. There is a bad flu going around this year, that's true though.\n\nI agree. Personal observation & experience is one of the absolute worst forms of scientific evidence\n\n>That was a surprise for me too. But the endpoints and outcomes of the protocol were approved and the trial results met the efficacy and safety standards. None of which were altered because of COVID. These are done by independent review boards and have to declare no conflicts of interest. There has also been failed mRNA COVID vaccines too, but that's less in the news. (Sanofi, Merck and GSK.)\n\nTechnically I believe the vaccines are still in phase 4. Correct me if I'm wrong. But to add to that, even looking at the MINIMUM timelines for each phase, it's over 2 years. I'm not sure when exactly they started, but I dont think it was October 2019\n\n>I can't speak on this particular local doctor's experience or anything. But the adverse events of the vaccines are readily available for you to review.\n\nNow this is a tough one. Again it kind of goes back to personal experiences, but at the same time, this is all so new and so much data at coming in all at once, it would be next to impossible to determine ALL of the adverse effects.

0x1d2e,"Here is a write-up I made some time back after I went through this and then had friends do so. Hope it helps!\n\nPantry moth (Indian meal moth): Plodia interpunctella. It is different from other meal moth species, including the common meal moth, Pyralis farinalis. Adults are tricolored above, wavy patterned below, and with the tiny abdomen tip held at about 90 degrees to body plane. Now pantropical (and in warm temperate regions), it may have originated in Central America.\n\nTheir diet is unusually broad, including grains and many foods made with at least some grain including cereals, breads, muffins, pasta, pet food, bird seed, but apparently also some nuts, candy bars, peanut butter, possibly starches such as corn starch, tapioca, etc.\n\nThe peak adult activity is around dusk. During daytime the adults mostly remain inactive in dark spots (e.g. crevices). Adults are moderately attracted to light, especially in the blue to violet range.\n\nThey are readily detectable using pheremone traps (scented tent-traps). Deter them by using airtight, adequate  food containers or double bagging, as well as using essential oils and nontoxic pantry moth spray. All stages including eggs are readily killed in a short time by temperatures over c. 130°F (e.g. in a car in the sun on a hot day) or freezing for 72 hours.\n\nUnlike most meal moths, the larvae of this species readily chew through paper, some plastics including processed-cereal freshness liners, and even thin cardboard. Double-bagging with Ziplock bags is normally adequate unless populations are large. Tupperware style containers only work if they completely seal (""airtight""). Put open food away promptly and avoid leaving pet food out more than a day or two.\n\nEdit: typos",Biology,here is a writeup i made some time back after i went through this and then had friends do so hope it helpsnnpantry moth indian meal moth plodia interpunctella it is different from other meal moth species including the common meal moth pyralis farinalis adults are tricolored above wavy patterned below and with the tiny abdomen tip held at about 90 degrees to body plane now pantropical and in warm temperate regions it may have originated in central americanntheir diet is unusually broad including grains and many foods made with at least some grain including cereals breads muffins pasta pet food bird seed but apparently also some nuts candy bars peanut butter possibly starches such as corn starch tapioca etcnnthe peak adult activity is around dusk during daytime the adults mostly remain inactive in dark spots eg crevices adults are moderately attracted to light especially in the blue to violet rangennthey are readily detectable using pheremone traps scented tenttraps deter them by using airtight adequate  food containers or double bagging as well as using essential oils and nontoxic pantry moth spray all stages including eggs are readily killed in a short time by temperatures over c 130f eg in a car in the sun on a hot day or freezing for 72 hoursnnunlike most meal moths the larvae of this species readily chew through paper some plastics including processedcereal freshness liners and even thin cardboard doublebagging with ziplock bags is normally adequate unless populations are large tupperware style containers only work if they completely seal airtight put open food away promptly and avoid leaving pet food out more than a day or twonnedit typos,1,0,0

0x98b,"1.The fact that he's young and healthy doesn't necessarily mean COVID won't hit him hard. Plus, the more people are vaccinated the better because the virus won't be able to transmit so easily, replicate and MUTATE. So we are more likely to get worse COVID variants if there are not enough people vaccinated. Not to mention there's a higher chance that he will spread it to his grandma or something. \n\n2. I honestly can't think how you can hit an artery in the upper arm muscle? Or even a major blood vessel.   But let's assume the vaccine goes straight into the blood stream. Nano-lipid particles are quite fragile. They're often covered in PEG to even make them stay longer in the bloodstream otherwise they would get opsonised and eaten by macrophages quickly. In order for these nano-lipids to ""enter every cell of the body"" they would have to extravasate from the blood stream and that wouldn't be so easy either (not to mention there wouldn't be enough of them to enter every cell). Usually people rely on cancer vasculature to be more ""leaky"" and try to use liposomes as drug carriers for instance. Because they would in theory accumulate in tumour. Probably the worst case scenario if by some miracle you injected the vaccine into the bloodstream would be that you might not develop an immunological memory for COVID or feel a bit worse. Even if mRNA entered some other cells, they would just start producing this spike protein. And sure, the immune cells would destroy these ""infected"" cells but there's nowhere near enough mRNA injected to cause any real damage that way (especially if it's dispersed and ""diluted"" in your body in this scenario). So essentially in the muscle the cells will start producing the spike protein (which is not secretory because some people wrongly suggest that you have a lot of this protein accumulated in your body), the immune cells such as dendritic cells (DCs) would find it, carry it to lymph nodes and activate T cells and B cells. There are a lot of DCs in the muscle so it's a great place to inject a vaccine. \n\n3. I honestly can't see how an mRNA vaccine can mess up your immune system and make it not work properly. It just mimicks what happens in any other viral infection. Your friend's argument is sooo general it's annoying. If he told you a suggested mechanism of action of this, then we can discuss. But like this? He should provide a source with a proof of that. \n\n4. Some people already answered. I don't really know the history of mRNA vaccine clinical trials so I won't say much. But let's not forget some companies didn't manage to make good mRNA vaccines for COVID (and tried), and that a lot of money and effort from thousands of scientist went to make these vaccines work. That for sure played a part in this success. \n\n5. I really don't like anegdotal evidence. What does it mean he ""measured""? Did this doctor actually designed a study and properly measured a correlation between a vaccination and all these diseases? And published it?

The numbering follows the one of Fischer's projections, being 1-sn the carbon at the top and 3-sn the one at the bottom.\n\nThe advantage of this particular notation is that the spatial configuration (D or L) of the glycero-molecule is determined intuitively by the residues on the positions sn-1 and sn-3.\n\nFor example sn-glycero-3-phosphoric acid and sn-glycero-1-phosphoric acid are enantiomers.\n\nMost vegetable oils have unsaturated fatty acids in the sn-2 position, with saturated fatty acids in the 1-sn and/or 3-sn position.[5] Animal fats more often have saturated fatty acids in the 2-sn, with unsaturated fatty acids in the 1-sn and/or sn3 position.[5]",Chemistry,from wikipediannin general glycerophospholipids use a sn notation which stands for stereospecific numbering5 when the letters sn appear in the nomenclature by convention the hydroxyl group of the second carbon of glycerol 2sn is on the left on a fischer projection the numbering follows the one of fischers projections being 1sn the carbon at the top and 3sn the one at the bottomnnthe advantage of this particular notation is that the spatial configuration d or l of the glyceromolecule is determined intuitively by the residues on the positions sn1 and sn3nnfor example snglycero3phosphoric acid and snglycero1phosphoric acid are enantiomersnnmost vegetable oils have unsaturated fatty acids in the sn2 position with saturated fatty acids in the 1sn andor 3sn position5 animal fats more often have saturated fatty acids in the 2sn with unsaturated fatty acids in the 1sn andor sn3 position5,0,1,2

0xaf3,"My knowledge of the nutrition literature is very sketchy further back than the year 2000.\n\nThe 9 essential amino acids were known by the 1940s. Its the same 9 essential amino acids for humans, cows, chickens, and *all* animals. No animal is an essential amino acid producer, they're all ""middlemen"". In evolution, creatures that evolved to eat plants or other animals lost the same set of metabolic pathways early, over 1000 million years ago.\n\nNutritional requirements for protein have become better defined with time. I'd recommend the WHO's [Protein and Amino Acid Requirements in Human Nutrition](http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/43411/WHO_TRS_935_eng.pdf;jsessionid=42513E10FE32E690D087BCDF2725806C?sequence=1), from 2007, for the still current consensus.\n\nThe requirements are fairly fixed by lean body mass, and its still common for some elderly to fall short, mostly because they're sedentary and eat so few calories in total that the dietary proportions that served them in youth no longer provide enough protein to support immune function. There's no requirement for the elderly to consume animal products, but for those who consume fewer calories in total, the requirement for protein may rise from the \~10% of calories required in younger people to 15-20% of calories. The additional protein could come from eggs & cheese, or from legumes and tofu.\n\nThere was an [interesting paper from 2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S155041311400062X) which found mild protein restriction was associated with protection against chronic disease and mortality, but only up to age 65 to 70. After that, higher protein intake in the 10-20% range improved survival. I think in this study we're seeing both some benefit from mild protein restriction in preventing cardiovascular and metabolic disease in middle age, and also a benefit of ensuring enough protein for our immune cells to proliferate in response to infection, in the elderly.\n\nI eat a plant based diet for health, and became fascinated with the nutrition and health literature about a decade ago. Because plant based diets can be unbalanced, I was concerned about the essential amino acids likely to be deficient. The key requirement for  is 30 mg/kg/day of lysine, and 15 mg/kg/day for methionine + cysteine (from table 49 of the WHO document cited above). Meet those, and its pretty much assured the other essential amino acids will be adequate. In practice, it generally means most plant based eaters need 2-3 servings of legumes daily, to ensure adequate lysine. People with weirder diets, like alcoholics, may need more protein heavy foods.",Biology,my knowledge of the nutrition literature is very sketchy further back than the year 2000nnthe 9 essential amino acids were known by the 1940s its the same 9 essential amino acids for humans cows chickens and all animals no animal is an essential amino acid producer theyre all middlemen in evolution creatures that evolved to eat plants or other animals lost the same set of metabolic pathways early over 1000 million years agonnnutritional requirements for protein have become better defined with time id recommend the whos protein and amino acid requirements in human nutritionhttpappswhointirisbitstreamhandle1066543411who_trs_935_engpdfjsessionid42513e10fe32e690d087bcdf2725806csequence1 from 2007 for the still current consensusnnthe requirements are fairly fixed by lean body mass and its still common for some elderly to fall short mostly because theyre sedentary and eat so few calories in total that the dietary proportions that served them in youth no longer provide enough protein to support immune function theres no requirement for the elderly to consume animal products but for those who consume fewer calories in total the requirement for protein may rise from the 10 of calories required in younger people to 1520 of calories the additional protein could come from eggs  cheese or from legumes and tofunnthere was an interesting paper from 2014httpswwwsciencedirectcomsciencearticlepiis155041311400062x which found mild protein restriction was associated with protection against chronic disease and mortality but only up to age 65 to 70 after that higher protein intake in the 1020 range improved survival i think in this study were seeing both some benefit from mild protein restriction in preventing cardiovascular and metabolic disease in middle age and also a benefit of ensuring enough protein for our immune cells to proliferate in response to infection in the elderlynni eat a plant based diet for health and became fascinated with the nutrition and health literature about a decade ago because plant based diets can be unbalanced i was concerned about the essential amino acids likely to be deficient the key requirement for  is 30 mgkgday of lysine and 15 mgkgday for methionine  cysteine from table 49 of the who document cited above meet those and its pretty much assured the other essential amino acids will be adequate in practice it generally means most plant based eaters need 23 servings of legumes daily to ensure adequate lysine people with weirder diets like alcoholics may need more protein heavy foods,1,0,0

0x17ef,My understanding is that the COVID vaccine creates a targeted protein found on most if not all variants for your immune system to build defenses against. Natural immunity may or may not target the same protein so it could be more effective against the strain you were infected with but not others.
